「ちょっとお願いがあるんだけど……いいかな？」=“I've got a bit of a request... mind hearing me out?”
「うん、どうしたの？」=“Sure, what's up?”
「突然だけど、俺のことを愛称で呼んでほしいんだ！」=“I know it's sudden but, I want you to call me by a nickname!”
「なぁんだ、そんなことか！　いいよー！　そうだ、せっかくだし、愛称、付け合いっこしようよー！」=“What, just that sort of thing? Sure! Right, since we're doing this, let's give each of us a nickname!”
「ありがとう。でも二人の愛称はもう考えてるんだ。俺のは[Pあだ名]っていうんだけど」=“Thanks. But, I've already got nicknames in mind for both of us. Mine would be [Pあだ名].”
「……あれ？　なにか違うような？」=“......Huh? Why does that sound a bit iffy to me, for some reason?”
「その……普通じゃないかもだけど、どうしても呼んでほしいんだ」=“That's... I know it's not the normal sort of nickname but, I really want to hear you call me that.”
「そっかぁ。うん、私に任せてよー！」=“I see. Yeah, leave it to me!”
「じゃあ早速～……[Pあだ名]♪」=“Well then, let's see~... [Pあだ名]♪”
「……ありがとう……[Hあだ名]」=“...Thanks... [Hあだ名].”
「ど、どうしたの！？　何か変だった？」=“W-What's the matter?! Did it sound weird when I said it?”
「いや変じゃないよ。ただ思ってたより威力があって……よかったら、また呼んでくれないかな？」=“No, it wasn't weird. It was just a lot more potent than I expected... if it's alright with you, won't you call me that again?”
「うん、全然いいよ。……[Pあだ名]♪」=“Yeah, I don't mind at all. ...[Pあだ名]♪”
「本当に、ありがとう……」=“Thank you, truly...”
