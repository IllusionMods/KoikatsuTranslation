「あっ……」=Ah--...
「どうかしたの？」=What's the matter?
「いや、何かお土産を買っとけばよかったかなって。お揃いのキーホルダーとか」=Nothing, I was just thinking that maybe it would have been nice to buy some sort of souvenirs, like matching keychains or whatever.
「今日の記念になるだろ？」=Would have been something to remember the day by, no?
「う～ん、そういう形に残るものもいいけど……素敵な思い出をたくさん貰ったから大丈夫だよ♪」=Mmm~, something like that might have been nice but... we made tons of wonderful memories instead, so I think it's fine♪
