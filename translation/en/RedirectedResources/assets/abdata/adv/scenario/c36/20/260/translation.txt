「さぁて、電車を降りるのが楽しみね？　普段はできない事、たくさんしましょう？」=Now then, excited to get off the train, aren't you? Let's do a lot of things that we normally can't do.
「あ～、俺、実は用事があって。一緒の駅では下りられないかも……なんてー」=Ah~, I actually had some things to do. We might not be able to get off on the same station...
「ふぅん、じゃあいいわよ。私が特別に合わせてあげる……逃げられると思わない事ねっ」=Hmmm, alright then. I'll get off at the same station, just for you... Don't think you can run from me--
