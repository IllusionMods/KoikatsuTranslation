「この公園、色んな花が咲いてるね」=This part has quite the variety of flowers, doesn't it?
「そうね。種類が多い事もだけど、きちんと手入れも行き届いている。いい公園だと思うわ」=Seems so. There's certaintly lots of variety, but they're also very well looked after. I think this is a good park.
「へぇ、[H名]さんって花とか好きなんだ？　意外な一面を発見だね」=Heh, You like flowers, huh, [H名]-san? What an unexpected side of yours.
「失礼ね。貴方みたいに肉欲だけで生きてはいないの。私が花を愛でるのが、そんなにおかしい？」=How rude. Unlike you, I don't live off of lust alone. Is it really that strange, for me to love flowers?
「いやいや、おかしくないよ。むしろ可愛いなって……思って」=Not at all. It's not strange at all. If anything... I thought it was very cute.
「見え透いたお世辞で誤魔化そうとしても無駄よ。貴方にはそうね、あの辺りに生えているのがお似合いかしら」=You can't hide behind that obvious flattery. For you, hmm. I wonder if that thing growing there would suit you.
「お世辞じゃないよ。本当に可愛いと思って……って、あれは雑草じゃ……」=It wasn't flattery. I really did think it was cute... Hey, that's just a weed...
「……やっぱり、どう見ても雑草だよね？」=... As expected, no matter how you look at it, that's just a weed isn't it.
「ブタクサという雑草よ。花粉症の原因にもなる嫌われ者ね」=It's a weed called ragweed, to be precise. It's quite an unpopular one too, as one of the causes of hayfever.
「そ、そうなんだ……詳しいんだね……」=I-Is that so... You sure know a lot about it...
「名前はもちろん、所構わず繁殖しようとするところなんか、貴方にぴったりでしょ？」=The name is a given, but the fact that it indiscriminantly reproduces on any occasion, don't you think it fits you perfectly?
「ぅぅ……まさかデート中に雑草扱いされるとは思ってなかったよ……」=Uuu... I didn't think I'd be compared to a weed in the middle of a date...
「あら、雑草だって馬鹿にしたものじゃないわよ？　貴方に例えた時は馬鹿にしていたけど」=Oh, but weeds aren't something to be ridiculed, you know? Ah but I was ridiculing them when comparing them to you though.
「ど、どっちなの！？」=W-Which one is it!?
「フフッ、良く言うでしょ、雑草根性って。私が好きなのは、綺麗な花だけじゃないわ」="Fufu, don't they say it a lot, ""as tenacious as a weed"" and all? I don't like only beautiful flowers, you know?"
「……じゃあ、どういう花が好きなの？」=... Then, what kind of flowers do you like?
「踏みつけても簡単に枯れたりしない花ね。生命力に溢れた雑草なんて、その点最高じゃない？」=Flowers that don't wither easily even when I trample them. The fact that weeds have overflowing vitality, isn't that the most amazing trait?
「えっ、それって……遠回りに俺の事、好きって言ってくれてる？」=Eh, By that... Are you saying that you like me, in a roundabout way?
「さぁ、どうかしらね？　少なくとも、私は綺麗なだけの花になんて興味はないわ」=Who knows? At the very least, I'm saying that I have no interest in flowers who have no claim to fame other than their beauty.
「お、俺っ、雑草根性で頑張るよ！　雑草っていいね！　最高だね！」=I-I'll do my best, with my weed-like tenacity! Weeds are great! Truly, the best!
「あら、何を一人で盛り上がっているのかしら？　そんなに踏みつけられたいの？」=Oh my, what are you getting all fired up for, all by yourself? Do you want me to trample you that much?
「い、いやぁ……ここだと目立ち過ぎるし……遠慮しておきます」=W-Well... We'll stand out a lot here so uh... I'll take a rain check on that.
