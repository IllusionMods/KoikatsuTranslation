「デート？　家畜の散歩に付き合えと？　それは、私に何の得があるのかしら？」=A date? Keeping livestock company during their stroll? What do I stand to gain from it?
「お、俺と仲良くなれる……とか？」=W-We'll become closer… and stuff?
「はっ、笑わせないで。自分がそんな大層な存在だと思っているの？　滑稽ね」=Ha--, Don't make me laugh. You think you're an existence worthy of being close with? Ridiculous.
「じゃあ、俺の休日の時間を、全て[H名]さんに捧げる……とか？」=Then, I'll devote a full day off to you, [H名]-san… how about that?
「ふぅん、それなら悪くないわね。丁度いいわ、色々やってみたい事があったの」=Hmm, that doesn't sound too bad. Perfect, actually, there are a few things I wanted to try out.
