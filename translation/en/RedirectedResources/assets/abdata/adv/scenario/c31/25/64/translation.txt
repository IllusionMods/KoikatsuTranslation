「邪魔する。はぁ、少しは慣れたが……やはり落ち着かないものだな」=I'm coming in. Haa, I've gotten a bit used to it but... I really can't seem to calm down here.
「部屋に呼んだら必ずシたがる輩がいるからな……それで落ち着けという方が無理な話だ……フフッ」=Afterall, if I'm called into this room, there's definitely someone going to be in here who wants to do it... If anything, calming down in such a situation is impossible... Fufu--
