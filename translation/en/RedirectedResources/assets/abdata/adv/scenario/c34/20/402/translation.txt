「さっきメニューを見てたとき、洋食のページを何度も見てたけど……和食より洋食派？」=“When you were looking at the menu just now, I saw that you kept looking at the western food page... Do you prefer western food over Japanese?”
「Ｏｈ，そんなトコロ見てたノ？　ン～……和食、洋食、ドッチも大好きダヨ！　ケドー……選ぶナラ、洋食カナ？　ズット食べた味ダカラ」=“Oh, you were watching? Nn~... I love both Western and Japanese food! But... If given the option, I'd go for western, I guess? It's a style I'm used to, after all.”
「なるほど。じゃあ、『海外に巨乳の人が多いのは、脂肪分の多い食生活をしてるから』って話は……」=“I see. Then, the rumour that 「There's lots of women in the west with big breasts, because of the fat content in their diets」is...”
「本当みたいだね」=“Seems like it's true.”
「モ～、ドコ見てるノ～？　アイカワラズ、エッチなんだカラ……♡」=“Jeez~, where are you looking~? Always so lewd...♡”
「いや、男としてはこのナゾについて言及してみたかったんだよ。[H名]の友達とかもそうだったのかな」=“No, I just wanted some reference on this mystery, as a man. Were your friends the same way, [H名]?”
「ト、思うデショ？　コッチに来てカラ、アッチと違うトコロ見つけて来たケド、変わらないヨ～」=“You'd think so, right? I've found lots of things that are different here compared to there but, that specific point hasn't changed~”
「！？　そんな、バカな……」=“!? That, it can't be...”
「アッチの友達、ワタシより大きいコ、イッパイいるヨ？　デモ、小さいコもイッパイだったネ。ニッポンも同じダヨ」=“There's lots of girls over there, that are bigger than me, you know? But, there were lots of girls that had smaller ones too. Japan's the same.”
「そっか～。てっきり、[H名]は外国の食べ物を食べてるから、そんなに胸が大きいんだと思ってたよ」=“I see~. I thought for sure that your bust size was because of your diet, [H名].”
「ン～……デモ、ソレは合ってるカナ。Ｍａｍａのオッパイは小さいカラ、遺伝じゃなくて、食べ物だと思うネ♡」=“Nnn~... But, there might be some truth to that. My mama has small boobs, so it's not hereditary, so it must be the food♡”
（とんでもない情報を引きずりだしてしまった……）=(Somehow all of that dragged out that bombshell...)
「ア、Ｍａｍａのオッパイ、想像してるノ？　ダメだよ、今アナタが考えていいのは、ワタシの大きなオッパイだけダカラネ！」=“Ah, are you imagining what my Mama's boobs looks like? Don't do that, the only boobs you're allowed to imagine in your head right now are mine!”
「わ、わかったから、あまり大声でオッパイって言わないで……！」=“I-I got it, so please don't shout "boobs" in that loud a voice...!”
「[H名]には関係のない話だね」=“Looks like it has absolutely no relation to you, huh?”
「チョットー！　ナンデ、ニコニコ笑顔で言うノ！？　マダマダ、コレカラダヨ！　将来は、Ｎｉｃｅ　ｂｏｄｙカモしれないヨ？」=“Hey! Why are you saying that with such a shitty grin on your face!? I still have lots of room to grow, okay?! I might sport a really nice body in the future, you know?”
「いや、そんなのダメだ……俺は今の[H名]の胸の大きさが好きなんだ……」=“No, you can't... I love your bust size as it is, [H名]...”
「ソンナ、コノヨノオワリみたいな顔しないでヨ」=“Don't make such a "My world is falling apart" expression.”
「あはは、まあ本音ではあるけど、成長は止められないし、俺はどんな[H名]でも好きになる自信はあるよ」=“Ahaha, well, that's how I really feel but, it's not like you can stop your growth, I believe that I can come to love you, no matter what sort of body you have, [H名].”
「フフ♡　ソーユーコト、サラッと言うの、ＫＯＩ－ＫＡＴＳＵ部の部長サンっぽいネ♡」=“Fufu♡ Just like you to say that so smoothly, Mr. Koikatsu Club President♡”
「あ、ちょっとキザなこと言ってたかな？　恥ずかし……」=“Ah, did I say something a bit too pretentious? So embarrassing...”
「ウウン、嬉しかったヨ♡　コレカラ、脂肪分の少ない、和食をイッパイ食べようって、思ったカラ♡」=“No, it made me happy♡ It made me want to eat the less fatty, Japanese style of food more often from now on♡”
