「何だか、終わった後の方が恥ずかしいわ。ばつが悪いというか……私のイメージが崩れなかった？」=For some reason, it's more embarrassing now that it's over. Like, It's so awkward or... Is your impression of me ruined now?
「そんなことないよ。初めてなのに、すごくエッチだったよ[H名]さん」=No, it's not. Even though it was your first time, you were super naughty, [H名]-san.
「そう。別に着飾ってるつもりはないんだけど、イメージと違ったって言われて離れてく友達もいたの」=I see. I don't mean to put on airs or dress flamboyantly, it's just that I've had friends who've distanced themselves from me because I wasn't what they expected.
「俺は素のままの[H名]さんが見られて嬉しかったよ。もっと見たいと思ったし」=I was happy that I got to see your true self, [H名]-san. It made me want to see even more of you.
「ええ、あなたの前ではいつも等身大の私でいられるの。これからもそういう関係でいていいのよね、ふふ」=Yes, I can always be myself in front of you. It's good that we can continue that sort of relationship, fufu~
