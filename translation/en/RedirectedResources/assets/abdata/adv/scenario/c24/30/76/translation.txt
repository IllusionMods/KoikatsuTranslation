「お待たせしました♡」=Sorry for making you wait♡
「おぉ……やっぱり似合うね！」=Oooh... You really do look great in that!
「うふふ♡　褒めてくれたので、さっきまで他の子をジロジロ見てたのは許してあげます♡」=Ufufu♡ Since you complimented me, I'll overlook how you were staring at the other girls♡
「うっ、やっぱり見られてた？」=Urgh--, so you really did see that?
（でも、前みたいなすごい嫉妬心は感じないな）=(But, I don't really feel the burning jealousy that she used to exude in the past.)
（付き合いはじめてから本当に余裕がでて、魅力的になったよな……）=(Man, she's becoming more and more attractive by the day, now that she's starting to calm down...)
