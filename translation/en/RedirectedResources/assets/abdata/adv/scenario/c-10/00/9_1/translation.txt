（うん、俺の気持ちを伝えよう）=(Yeah, I'll tell her how I feel)
部員全員が帰り、プールに残ったのは俺たちだけになった。=All of the club members had gone, and we were the only ones left at the pool.
「水瀬さん、ちょっといい？」=Miss Minase, do you have a moment?
亜依=Ai
「うん、なーに？」=Yeah, what is it?
「この前の……告白の答えなんだけど」=The other day... you asked me how I really felt.
「へえっ！？　あ、あ、えっと、う、うん……」=Hey!? Ah, ah, well, uh, um...
水瀬さんは一瞬で真っ赤になり、落ち着きを失ってしまう。=Miss Minase instantly turns bright red and loses her composure.
（平静を装ってたけど、ずっここんな感じだったのかな。もう、安心させてあげないと！）=(She was trying to act calm, but I wonder if she was like this all along. I need to put her mind at ease her now!)
俺は水瀬さんをまっすぐに見つめると、口を開いた。=I stared straight at Miss Minase and began to speak.
