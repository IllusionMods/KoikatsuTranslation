「そのオムライス、美味しそうだね」=“That omurice sure looks delicious.”
「ええ。評判のランチメニューみたいだから、期待が持てるわ」=“Yes. Seems like this place is pretty famous for it too, so I'm excited.”
「ハンバーグとかも人気があるみたいだけど、そっちはいいの？」=“Their hamburg steak seems pretty popular too, you sure you're fine with the omurice?”
「そっちも気になったんだけど、この卵のふわふわな感じに惹かれたの」=“I was curious about the steak too but, in the end the promise of the extra fluffy eggs won me over.”
「本当だ。スプーンでつついただけでも分かるね」=“For real. Just poking them with a spoon is enough to show just how fluffy they are.”
「早速いただきましょう。はむっ……」=“Let's dig in already. *chew*...”
「どう？　感想は？」=“How is it? You like it?”
「ふわぁ～……思っていた以上に美味しいわ！」=“So fluffy~... it's even more delicious than I expected!”
「幸せそうに食べるなぁ……俺も食べたくなってきたよ」=“You're sure eating that really happily... now I want some too.”
「そうね、これほどの幸福は共有しないともったいないわ」=“Yeah, it would be a waste to not share some of this happiness with you.”
「本当に？　言ってみるもんだね」=“You sure? Glad I asked.”
「おすそわけしてあげるわ。はい、あーん……」=“I don't mind sharing at all. Here, open up~...”
「えっ？　あーん……」=“Eh--? Aaaahn...”
「もぐもぐ……」=*chew chew*...
「どう？　美味しいでしょ？」=“So? It's delicious, no?”
「……うん、美味しい。卵が口の中で溶けていくみたいだ……」=“...Yeah, it is. It feels like the egg's just melting in my mouth...”
「ふふ……あなたも虜になったわね」=“Fufu... it's gotten you falling for it too.”
