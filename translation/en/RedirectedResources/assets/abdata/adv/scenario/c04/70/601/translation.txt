「へえ……意外と綺麗に掃除されてるのね。もっと汚れてるのかと思ってたわ……」=“Hoh... it's a pretty neat and tidy place, all things considered. I thought it'd be a bit more filthy...”
「清掃はいきとどいてるみたいだね。……というか、緊張してる？　なんだかたどたどしいような……」=“Seems that they're pretty diligent with the cleanup. ...Are you nervous? I feel like you're moving a bit awkwardly...”
「少しだけ、ね……こういうトコ、初めてだから……」=“I am, just a little bit... it's my first time, in a place like this...”
「そっか……じゃあ、緊張をほぐしてあげなきゃだね」=“I see... well then, guess I gotta help you loosen up those nerves some first.”
「いやらしい手つき……ほぐされるのは、緊張ではなさそうね」=“Such lewd hands... really doesn't seem like it's my nerves, that you're trying to loosen up there~”
