「喫茶店にいる人達って、皆自由って感じだよね」=“People in coffee shops seem to be free, don't they?”
「そうですね。人間観察をするには、一番面白い場所かもしれません」=“Yes, they do. It's probably the most interesting place to observe people.”
「あ、そういえば趣味なんだっけ？　人間観察」=“Oh, by the way, what's your hobby?　People watching.”
「はい、お恥ずかしながら。趣味といっても、暇潰しの延長のようなものですが……」=“Yes, I'm ashamed to say it. I'm ashamed to admit it, but it's just an extension of my spare time...”
「へぇ、どんなところを観察してるの？」=“Really? What do you observe?”
「そうですねぇ……あっ、今入ってきた男女の二人組、カップルだと思いますか？」=“Well... do you think the two men and women who just walked in are a couple?”
「うーん、どうだろ……女の子の方はくっつきたがってるけど、男はそうでもない……みたいな？」=“Well, I don't know... The girl wants to get together, but the guy doesn't ... seem to want to?”
「まぁっ、どうしてそう思ったのですか？　よろしければ、貴方の意見を聞かせてください」=“Well, what makes you think that?　If you don't mind, I'd like to know your opinion.”
「え、何て言うか……女の子は楽しそうでキラキラした感じだけど……男子はだるそうっていうか……」=“Well, I mean, the ... girls look happy and sparkly, but the ... guys look sluggish.”
「なるほど、それで女の子の片思いだと思ったのですね？　ふふ、興味深いお話です」=“I see, so that's why you thought it was a girl's crush?　Hmm, interesting story.”
「[H名]はどう思った？　あの二人、実はもう付き合ってるとか？」=“What did [H名] think?　Do you think they're actually together?”
「いいえ、きっとあのお二人は姉弟ですね。お姉さんに無理矢理喫茶店に連れてこられた弟さん、だと思います」=“No, I think they're siblings. No, I think they're brother and sister. I think they're brother and sister who were forcibly brought to the coffee shop by their sister.”
「へ？　なんで？　姉弟にしては距離感近過ぎじゃない？」=“Huh?　Why?　Aren't they too close for a sister and brother?”
「ええ、だからですよ。あれだけ距離感が近くて、それにお姉さんはとても綺麗なのに、男の人が何も反応しない方が変なのです」=“Yes, that's why. It's strange that a man doesn't react to a woman who is so close to him and who is so beautiful.”
「あー、そういうことか。つまり迫られても欲情しない相手、身内ってことだね？」=“Oh, I see. So you're saying that you're the one who doesn't feel lustful when pressed?”
「は、はい、私はそのように考えました……えぇと、貴方は私が迫ったら、その、欲情……して頂けるのでしょうか？」=“Yes, that's what I thought... Well, if I were to come on to you, would you, you know, lust ...?”
「へっ、えっ……ちょ、待って！　それ、喫茶店でする話じゃないよね？」=“Heck, no... Wait!　That's not something you want to talk about in a coffee shop, is it?”
「えっ、あっ、私……大変失礼いたしましたっ！　えぇと、あっ、あちらの男性二人組は……どのような関係だと思います？」=“What? Oh, I ... am so sorry!　What kind of relationship do you think the two men over there have with ...?”
「え？　どこの？　あー、あれかな？　うーんと、会社の同僚……とかじゃない？　ハハハ……」=“What?　Where?　Uh, that one?　I think they're colleagues from ...　Hahaha ...”
（[H名]の観察眼が確かなのは分かったけど、その後の方がインパクトあり過ぎて……まだドキドキしてるよ……）=(I knew that [H名] had a good eye for observation, but what came after that had too much of an impact on me... I'm still nervous...)
