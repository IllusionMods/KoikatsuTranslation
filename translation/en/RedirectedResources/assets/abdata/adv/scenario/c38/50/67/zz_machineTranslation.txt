「この校門からの景色も、貴方と一緒だと違って見えますね」=“The view from the school gate looks different when you're with me.”
「そういえば、たまに一人で眺めてたりしてたよね。何を見てたの？」=“The view from the school gate looks different with you. What were you looking at?”
「うっ、変な趣味だと笑わないでくださいね？　出入りする人を眺めるのが、趣味だったのです」=“Ugh, don't laugh at my weird hobby, okay?　It was my hobby to watch people come and go.”
「へぇ、そうだったんだ。じゃあ、帰る前にもう少し眺めてく？　俺も付き合うよ」=“Oh, I didn't know that. Well, do you want to look around some more before you leave?　I'll join you.”
「ふふ、貴方は少し反則です。いつもそうやって、私の予想以上の、嬉しい言葉をくださるのですから」=“Hmm, you're a bit foul. You always say things that make me happy and exceed my expectations.”
