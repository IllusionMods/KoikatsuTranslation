「……んー、約束の時間なのに、来ないな。って、あ……来た来た………………って、随分ゆっくり歩いてる……遅刻してるのに」=...Nnn, it's already the time we said we'd meet up on, but she's not here. Wait, that's... that's her alright... and she's sure walking real leisurely... even though she's late.
「ごきげんよう、お待たせてしてしまいまして？」=Good day to you. Did I make you wait?
「あ、うん……少しね。けど、随分ゆっくり歩いて来ていたね」=Ah, yeah... a little bit. But, you were walking pretty darn leisurely there, weren't you?
「ふふ、男性は待たせて当然ですもの。それに、このわたくしが遅刻ごときで慌ててしまうとお思い？　さ、参りましょう」=Fufuh, it is only natural for a man to have to wait. Besides, do you think one such as me would concern herself with concepts such as lateness? Now then, let us go.
「う、うん、エスコートさせてもらうよ」=O-Okay. I'll escort you.
