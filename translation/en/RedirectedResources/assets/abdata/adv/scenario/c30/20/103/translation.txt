「[H名]さえよければ、まだ一緒にいたいな。……時間って大丈夫？」=“If it's alright with [H名], I wanna be together for little longer... Are you okay for time?”
「ええ、もちろん大丈夫よ。今日はキミのためだけに時間をとってあるもの」=“Yes, of course that's fine. I set aside the whole day to spend time with you.”
「本当？　嬉しいなぁ」=“Really? That makes me happy.”
「ふふ、嬉しいのは私も一緒よ」=“Fufu, the one who's happy is me.”
「え？」=“Eh?”
「私も……まだお別れしたくなかったから。一緒にいたいと思ってくれて嬉しいの」=“I'm the same... I don't want to separate either. I'm glad you want to be with me too.”

「え？　何か言った？」=“Eh? Did you say something?”
「ううん、何でもないわ。それより、手を繋いで送ってくれるんでしょ？」=“No, nothing. That aside, didn't you say you were going to walk me home while holding hands?”
「あ、うん……きちんと送り届けるよ」=“Ah, yeah... I'll properly drop you off.”
