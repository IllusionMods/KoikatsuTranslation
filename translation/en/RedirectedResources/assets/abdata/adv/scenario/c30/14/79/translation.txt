「あら、揚げ物がたくさん……キミ、そんなに揚げ物好きなの？」=Oh? So much fried food... Do you really love fried food that much?
「あはは、そういうわけじゃないんだけど……これくらい食べておかないと午後にお腹減っちゃって……」=Ahaha, That's not exactly the case. It's just that if I don't eat atleast this much then I get extremely hungry by the afternoon.
「ふふ、授業中にお腹がなったら恥ずかしいものね。でも、食べすぎには注意するのよ？」=Fufu~ If your stomach were to rumble midway through class, certainly it would be very embarrassing. But, you should be careful about not eating too much, alright?
「そうなのね」=You're right.
