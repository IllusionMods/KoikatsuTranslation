「いい天気。お散歩日和だねぇ」=“Such nice weather. Truly perfect for a walk, isn't it?”
「はい。貴方と肩を並べて歩き、お話をさせていただけるなんて、嬉しいです。心が安らぎます」=“Yes. To think I can walk shoulder to shoulder with you, and even chat with you, I'm so happy. It makes my hear feel so at ease.”
（こういう時間の過ごし方が出来るのは、[H名]とぐらいかもなぁ）=(I think her and I might be the only ones, who can enjoy spending time like this.)
「あら、ご覧ください。サツキが咲いております」=“Oh my, please look. There's some Azalea growing over there.”
「あ、これ、小さいころ蜜を吸った花だ。サツキって言うんだ、知らなかったな」=“Ah, we used to suck the nectar out of these flowers as kids. So they're called Azalea, huh? Never knew.”
「では、こちらの草はいかがですか？」=“Oh? What do you think is the grass growing over here then?”
「あ、これ、草相撲とか言って、茎を絡ませて引っ張りっこしたやつだ！」=“Ah, we used to wrap the stems of these around each other and pull them out, we even called it 'grassroots sumo wrestling' and stuff!”
「人の往来が激しい場所に生息するので、茎がとても強靭なのです。オオバコと申しまして、生薬としても親しまれております」=“They grow in places with lots of human footfalls, so their stems are quite strong indeed. Called 'plantains', they're used quite frequently in herbal medicine as well.”
「[H名]は物知りなんだね。俺、何も知らないで蜜吸ったり草相撲したり、ちょっと恥ずかしいなぁ」=“You sure know your stuff, [H名]. Compared to you, how I used to suck on their nectar, or play sumo with them, sure feels a bit embarrassing now.”
「ふふ、殿方らしくて宜しいかと存じます。幼少時代から無邪気な方だったのですね」=“Fufuh, I personally think such things are quite manly in their own right. It just goes to show that you've always been an innocent spirit inside, ever since you were a little boy.”
「小さい頃かぁ。[H名]は小さい頃からあまり変わってないイメージだけど、どうなの？」=“Back then, huh~. I feel like you're probably not someone who's changed much herself, am I right?”
「くすっ、もしかしたら、貴方より無邪気な子供だったかもしれません。事あるごとに駄々をこね、厳しいお稽古から逃げ出してお外で遊んでおりました」=“*Giggle*, I may just have been even more innocent than you were. Whining about every little thing, always running away from the harsh lessons just to play around outside.”
「えー、意外！　いつから今の[H名]みたいになったの？」=“Eeh~, that's a surprise! Since when did you change to be the way you are now?”
「それは……」=“That's...”
「あ、言いにくいことだった？」=“Ah, should I not have asked?”
「いえ……少し、恥ずかしいだけでございます」=“No... it's just, a bit embarrassing.”
「私が祖母や母のように淑やかな女性を目指したきっかけ。お聞きになりますか？」=“The reason why I eventually decided to attempt to become the same sort of lady, as my mother, and my grandmother. Would you like to hear it?”
「え、っと……[H名]さえよければ」=“Eh, erhm... if that's alright with you?”
「……初潮を迎え、子を産める身体になってからでございます」=“...It was the day I faced my first menstruation, the day my body gained the ability to bear children.”
「それから男女のことを意識するようになり、まだ見ぬ素敵な殿方を夢見て、花嫁修業に邁進いたしました」=“Ever since then, the matters between the sexes started taking more and more space in my head, and I started undertaking housewife training, while dreaming of my own wonderful man the whole time.”
「ご、ごめん、そんな言いにくいこと言わせて……」=“S-Sorry, that was very personal, I shouldn't have put you on the spot...”
「謝らないでくださいまし。私が貴方に聞いていただきたいと思ったので、お話いたしました。私は、貴方の為に今のような性格になったのですよ」=“You do not need to apologize. I said as much because I wanted you to hear it. I became the lady I am, all for you.”
「なら責任をもって、[H名]のことを大切にしないとね」=“I guess I'll just have to take responsibility then, and treasure you.”
（こういう話って、なかなか出来ないよな。たまには散歩もいいなぁ）=(Man, this sort of chat isn't something you can have anytime you want. Walks like these are nice too, every once in a while.)
