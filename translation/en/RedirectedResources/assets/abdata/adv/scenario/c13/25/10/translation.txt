「[P]くんが部長なんだよね？　まぁ、アタシも暇だし入ってもいいけど……」=“You're the club president, right? Well, it's not like I have anything to do, so I don't mind joining...”
「本当？　ならそうしてくれると嬉しいな」=“For real? In that case, I'd love to have you join.”
「何もそんなにはしゃぐことないじゃん。今まで通り一緒にいるだけなんでしょ？」=“It's nothing to get that excited over. It's just gonna be a whole lot more of what we've been doing till now, no?”
「まぁ……でもせっかく部活に入ってくるなら、今まで以上に仲良くなれるようなことをしたな、なんて」=“Well... I was just thinking that if you were gonna join the club, we could do stuff that could bring us even closer together, and stuff. Just a thought.”
「あ、今ちょっとエッチなこと考えたでしょ」=“Ah, you thought of something lewd just then, didn't you?”
「うっ……ごめん、ちょっと考えちゃってた」=“Uu--... sorry, I did a little.”
「やらし～。でも……[P]くんだったら特別に……な～んてね」=“Lewd~. But... I could make an exception for you, [P]-kun... just kidding~”
