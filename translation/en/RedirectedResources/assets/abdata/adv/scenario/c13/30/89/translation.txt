「俺たち、そろそろ次の段階に行くべきだと思うんだ」=“I think it's about time we moved onto the next step in our relationship.”
「どしたの急に。次の段階って結婚とか？」=“What's the matter, all of a sudden? By "the next step", do ya mean marriage or something?”
「そ、それは一番最後だと思う……。えっとさ、お互いに愛称で呼び合わない？」=“I-I think that comes at the very end... Erhm, say, wanna call each other by nicknames?”
「んー、そういえばアタシらそういうのなかったね。いいよ、いいよー」=“Nnn, come to think of it, we didn't have any of those, did we? Alright, sure.”
「やった！　じゃあ俺のことは[Pあだ名]って呼んでくれないかな？」=“Yay! Then, won't you try calling me [Pあだ名]?”
「ま、マジで言ってる？　ちょっと引いちゃうんですけど……」=“A-Are you being serious? That's seems a bit creepy...”
「お願い！　男の夢を叶えると思って……」=“Please! Just think of it as making a dream of mine come true...”
「……まぁ、かわいいキミの頼みだし、いっか。その代わり、可愛い愛称、付けてよね？」=“...Well, it's a request from my adorable boyfriend, so I guess it's fine. In return, give me a cute one too, okay?”
「任せてよ！　えっと……[Hあだ名]」=“Leave it to me! Erhm... [Hあだ名].”
「んー、まあまあかな。それじゃあアタシも……[Pあだ名]」=“Nnn, passable. Well then, me too... [Pあだ名].”
「……うん、提案しといてアレだけど、わりと照れくさい……」=“...Yeah, I'm not in a position to be saying this since I did kinda bring this but, but that's pretty embarrassing...”
「アタシも……ドキドキした。次の段階に行くのはちょっと早かったかもねー」=“Me too... my heart was racing. Maybe it was a bit too fast for us to move to the next step.”
「そ、そうかな？　俺としてはまた呼んでほしいんだけど……」=“Y-You think so? I'd love to hear you call me that again sometime though...”
「しょうがないなあ。呼ばれるの嬉しいみたいだし、たまにならいいよ♪」=“Can't be helped then. Looks like it makes you happy when I call you that, so I guess it's fine every once in a while♪”
