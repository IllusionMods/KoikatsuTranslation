「やっぱり綺麗ですね」=“It really is beautiful, isn't it?”
「うん。いつ来てもいい場所だよね」=“Yeah. It's a good place, no matter the time.”
「こんなに綺麗な夜景を[H名]と一緒に見られるなんて、ホント幸せだよ」=“Being able to see such a pretty nightscape with you, [H名], I really feel blessed.”
「さすがにそれは言い過ぎな気がしますが」=“I feel like you're exaggerating a bit too much.”
「そうかな。俺の本心のつもりだよ？」=“Am I? It's how I really feel, you know?”
「今更ですが不思議ですね、あなたは」=“I know it's a bit late to say this but, you really are a bit odd.”
「あなたのような人、初めてです」=“It's the first time I've ever known a person like you.”
「それこそ言い過ぎじゃない？　俺はごくごく普通の学生だよ」=“Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration instead? I'm just an ordinary unremarkable student.”
「私に恋心を抱く。それは普通のことですか？」=“Is being in love with me something ordinary?”
「誰かを好きになるのは、特別なことじゃないと思うよ。俺にとって[H名]は魅力的な女の子だしね」=“I don't think that falling in love with someone is that extraordinary a thing. Especially since, to me, you're a very attractive girl, [H名].”
「やっぱりあなたは普通じゃありません」=“You really aren't an normal person.”
「言葉だけ聞くと辛辣だなぁ。悪気がないのは分かってるけどね」=“Taking your words at face value really does sting quite a bit. Though, I know you don't mean anything bad by them.”
「まあ、とにかく俺は[H名]が好きってことだよ」=“Well, in any case, it's true that I love you, [H名].”
CHOICE:『ここでエッチしちゃうくらいにね』=『So much so that we could have sex in here』
CHOICE:『また一緒に夜景を見に来ようね』=『Let's come again to look at the night sky』
「ここでエッチしちゃったくらいにね」=“So much so that we've had sex in this place.”
「そうですね、私も盛り上がってしまいました」=“Indeed, I've gotten quite fired up too.”
「それで……さ。今日もシちゃわない？」=“And... So. Wanna do it today too?”
「ええ、構いませんよ」=“Yes, I don't mind.”
「それに私は、この夜景を見る頃には以前シたエッチの事を思い出していましたから」=“Besides, by the time we came to look at the night sky here, I'd started thinking about how we had sex here last time.”
「既に……準備は出来ています」=“I'm already... ready to go.”
「[H名]……」=“[H名]...”
「行きましょう。私達が一つになれる場所へ」=“Let's go. To the place where we can become one.”
「流石に遅くなって来たね……いつかまた、一緒に夜景を見に来ようね」=“It really has gotten quite late... Let's come again some day to loo at this night sky, alright?”
「はい。楽しみにしてます」=“Yes. I look forward to it.”
「よしっ。じゃあ今日はそろそろ帰ろっか」=“Alright--. Then, shall we go home for the day?”
「そうですね。では――」=“Indeed. Well then--”
「あっ。手、繋ぐ？」=“Ah--, Gonna hold hands?”
「その方がいいかと思ったのですが」=“I thought it would be better that way but,”
「ダメでしたか？」=“Is it really no good?”
「ううん。むしろ喜んで」=“No, If anything, I'm really happy.”
「――っと。これでＯＫだね。行こうか」=“----and, there, we're good to go. Shall we?”
「はい」=“Yes.”
