「何を考えている！　ここは女子用だ！」=“What are you thinking!? This is the woman's toilet!”
「おまえというやつはっ！」=“Guys like you are--!”
「今は時間がない。それくらい察しろ」=“I don't have time right now. Guess that much, atleast.”
「なんだ？　用があるならさっさと言え」=“What? If you need something, spit it out.”
「すまんな、今は構ってやれる暇がない」=“Sorry, I don't have time for this right now.”
「んぅぅ～、すぅ～、んふふっ……ふぁぅ……」=“Nnnnn~, Ssuu~, Nnfufu--... Fuah......”
「んんぅ……何を見ている？　そんなに怒鳴られたいか？」=“Nnnn... What are you looking at? You really want to be yelled at that badly?”
「んっ、どこを見ている？　ジロジロ見るな……減る」=“Nn--, just where do you think you're looking at? Don't stare so much... it'll wear out.”
「ほぅ、奇遇だな。一緒に空でも眺めるか？」=“Hoh, what a coincidence. Wanna watch the sky together?”
「私に話かける暇があるなら、走りこみでもしたらどうだ？」=“If you have the time to chat me up, why don't you go for a run instead?”
「水は好きか？　ただ浮いているだけでも、気持ちいいものだぞ」=“You like swimming? Just floating around feels amazing too.”
「どこかに行くのか話すのか、結局何がしたいのだ？」=“Talking or going somwhere, just what is it you want?”
「一緒なら入れると思ったか？　残念、そこは男子禁制だ」=“Did you think you'd get in if I was with you? Sorry to say, that place is off-limits to men.”
「ん？　どうした？　用があるなら、聞いてやるぞ」=“Hm? What's up? If you need something, I'll hear you out.”
「その、私が男の体に興味があると言ったら……どうする？」=“Uhm, if I told you I had an interest in a man's body... what'd you do?”
「体は全ての資本だぞ。鍛えてやろうか？」=“Your body is the only thing that'll never betray you. Shall we train?”
「なんだ、コイカツ部はどうした？　早速廃部か？」=“What about the koikatsu club? Already disbanded?”
「何をフラフラしている。時間は有限だぞ」=“What are you loitering about for? You only have so much time, you know?”
「ふぅ、もう昼か。で、おまえは何をしている？」=“Fuu, already noon, huh? So, what are you up to?”
「さて、今日も終わりか……ふぅ、肩が凝ったな」=“Today's over too, huh... Fuu, man my shoulders are stiff.”
「んやっ！　ッ、今の声は忘れろ……わかったな」=“Nnyah--! --!, Forgot what you heard just now... Got it?”
「なんだ？　何か用か？」=“What is it? Need something?”
「なんて言うか……[H名]って落ち着いてて、凄く大人びてるよね？」=“How do I say this, you're a very calm and mature person, aren't you, [H名]?”
「フッ、褒めているつもりか？　何か企んでいるなら、無駄だぞ」=“Pfft, trying to butter me up? If you're scheming something, it's useless.”
「老けていると言いたいのか？　いやすまん、否定的過ぎたな」=“Trying to say I look old? Nah, sorry, even for me that was too cynical.”
「体を鍛えてみようと思うんだけど……」=“I'm thinking of trying and tempering my body but...”
「ほぅ、それはいい心掛けだ。よし、基本から教えてやろう」=“Hoh, that's a nice attitude to have. Alright, I'll start you up from the basics.”
「どういう風の吹き回しだ？　そんなに私に気に入られたいのか？」=“Now where did that come from? You want me to like you that much?”
「[H名]って、結構面倒見いいよね」=“You're a pretty caring person, aren't you, [H名]?”
「なっ……ま、まぁ、気に入った奴には……少しだけな」=“Wha--... W-Well, just a little bit... only with people I like.”
「たしかにな、わざわざそんな事を言うおまえ以外にはだが」=“Yeah, I am, but there's no one who'd go out of their way to say that except you.”
「……他に何か話題はないのか？」=“...Do you have anything else you want to talk about?”
「休みの日って、何してるの？」=“What do you do on your days off?”
「色々だ……って、何故そこで残念そうな顔をする」=“Stuff...--uh, why are you making such a disappointed face at that?”
「悩んだら買っちゃう派？　保留派？」=“When you're split on something, are you the type to buy it, or to hold off?”
「買う派、だな。悩むという事は、いつかは買うわけだからな」=“Just like me, huh? Afterall, if you're split on it, that means you'll end up buying it one day anyway.”
「笑ってみてくれない？　ニコーって」=“Won't you try smiling? Like this.”
「なんだそれは……どうしても見たいのなら、もっと工夫しろ」=“What's with that... If you really want to see it, try making me smile instead.”
「恋人が欲しいって思った事ある？」=“Have you ever thought about wanting a lover?”
「ま、まぁ思った事……くらいは。私だって、女だからな……」=“W-Well, I have... thought about it. I'm a girl too, afterall...”
「特にはないな。そう言うおまえはどうなんだ？」=“Not in particular, no. What about you though?”
「恋人には尽くすタイプ？」=“Are you the type to serve your lover?”
「そうだな。特別な関係なのだ、尽くして損はあるまい」=“Yeah, I guess. It's a special relationship, you won't lose out by giving it your all.”
「そう見えるか？　気になるなら、自分で確かめてみてはどうだ？」=“Do I look like that? If you're curious, how about you see for yourself?”
「いきなりだけど、好きな男性のタイプは？」=“I know this is a bit abrupt but, what kind of guys do you like? Your type and stuff.”
「本当にいきなりだな。だが、そういう積極的なやつは、嫌いじゃないぞ」=“That really is abrupt. But, I don't hate that sort of assertiveness, you know?”
「特に考えた事もなかったが……腰が重い奴といると腹が立つな」=“I've never really given it much thought but... people who're really slow to act really piss me off.”
「いきなりそんな事を聞かれて、答えるわけがないだろう」=“Asking something like that so abruptly, do you really expect me to answer that?”
「女子ってコイバナ好きだよねー」=“Girls really do love chatting about love and stuff, don't they?”
「そう決めつけるのはどうかと思うが……まぁ、好きな奴は多いな」=“While I don't think too well of the way you're just assuming things about all of us... well, there are lots of girls who like that sort of stuff.”
「女子同士の恋愛って、あったりした？」=“Ever had a romance going with a girl?”
「そ、それは……私がという事か？　い、いや、教えんぞ」=“T-That's... Are you asking about me? N-No, I ain't telling you.”
「[H名]って、お姉様とか女王様とか、呼ばれてそうだよね？」=“[H名], seems like you're the type to get called "Onee-sama~" or "My Queen!" by others, aren't you?”
「ほぅ、何故そう思ったのか、聞かせて欲しいな」=“Hoh, what makes you think that? I'd like to hear the answer.”
「積極的な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of assertive guys?”
「悪くはないな。動きがある奴の方が、見ていて楽しい」=“They're not bad. It's more fun to watch energetic guys.”
「面倒だな。聞こえはいいが、要は考え無しだろう？」=“They're a pain. They sounds okay but when you stop to think about it, they're just inconsiderate, no?”
「慎重な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of careful and prudent guys?”
「いいと思うぞ。先を予測できるものは案外貴重だからな」=“I think they're nice. The ability to plan ahead is unexpectedly nice.”
「ダメだな。考え過ぎて動けなくなっては意味があるまい」=“They're no good. There's no point in overthinking and stalling on the start-line.”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of diligent guys?”
「あぁ、良いな。もし今がダメでも、将来有望というやつだ」=“Aah, they're nice. Even if they're not any good right at the moment, they have bright futures ahead of them.”
「却下だな。真面目をこじらせた奴ほど面倒なものはいない」=“Not for me. Nothing worse than guys who get overly serious.”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys that go at their own pace?”
「見所があるな。他に影響されないやつは、何かと強い」=“I think it's a nice quality to have. People who don't get pulled around by others are stronger in many ways.”
「無理だな。空気が読めない奴といると疲れる」=“Not for me. Guys who can't read the mood are really tiring.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of kind, gentle guys?”
「思いやりは基本だな、それさえ無い奴なんて論外だ」=“Thoughtfulness is the most basic of basic things, and guys without that are simply out of the question.”
「優しさを押し付けられてもな、無さすぎるのも問題とは思うが」=“It's not nice to have kindness forced upon you, though guys lacking it entirely are no good either, in my opinion.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cool and trendy guys?”
「度が過ぎなければ、無駄に喚く奴よりは付き合いやすいか」=“As long as they don't take it too far, they're easier to get along with compared to guys who just pointlessly make noise.”
「むぅ、からかい甲斐がないというのはつまらないな」=“Muu, guys who don't react do teasing and banter are boring.”
「女の子もエッチに興味とかあるのかな？」=“Do girls have an interest in lewd stuff too?”
「ないと言ったら嘘になるな、個人で大小はあるだろうが」=“It'd be a lie if I said no, but the amount of interest depends on the individual.”
「女子に綺麗な妄想を抱くのは勝手だが、わりとえげつないぞ？」=“You can have your pretty fantasies about girls all you want, but we're all pretty dirty inside, you know?”
「自分の胸とか触った事ある？」=“Do you ever feel up your own breasts?”
「はぁ、男はすぐに胸の話をしたがるな。そんなに好きか？」=“Haa, boys always love jumping at any chance to talk about breasts, don't they? You like them that much?”
「んぅ、そう遠回しに言うと、余計いやらしく聞こえるぞ」=“Nnn, when you phrase it like that, I can't help but hear it in a lewd way.”
「女子ってどういう時にムラムラするの？」=“At what sorts of times do girls go horny?”
「それを聞いて、おまえはどうするつもりなんだ？　ん？」=“And what exactly do you plan on doing with the answer to that? Hmm?”
「それは性別もあるかもしれないが、個人差だろう」=“That might depend on the gender as well but, in general it depends on the person, no?”
「はぁ、仕方ないと思う部分もあるが……少しは慎め」=“Haa, while I do understand that you're just curious... Tone it down a bit, that sort of stuff.”
「エッチな本、貸してあげようか？」=“Want me to lend you a porn mag?”
「願い下げだな。そもそも貸し借りするものではないだろう」=“Spare me. In the first place, they're not something you should be lending out, no?”
「この前さ……見ちゃったんだ……」=“The other day... I saw...”
「な、何をだ？　め、目がいやらしいぞ！」=“S-Saw what? Y-Your eyes are really obscene!”
「昨日、エッチな夢を見たんだ……」=“Last night, I had a wet dream...”
「あー、続きは言わなくていいぞ……」=“Aah, you don't need to tell me the rest...”
「たまにだが、クラスの奴等に避けられる事がある……私は怖いのか？」=“Sometimes, people in class tend to avoid me... Am I scary?”
「やはりそうか……少しだけ、考え直してみよう……」=“As I thought... I'll try changing a bit, I suppose...”
「フッ、おまえに怖がられていないのなら、良しとしよう」=“Pfft, well as long as you're not scared of me, I suppose I'll consider that good enough.”
「曖昧な言葉で誤魔化そうとするな。不愉快だ」=“Don't try to dodge the question with vague responses. It's really unpleasant.”
「おまえ、動物は好きか？　少し気になってな……」=“Do you like animals? I've been a bit curious...”
「ほぅ、私と同じだな。猫はいい、うん、特にいいな」=“Hoh, I'm the same way. Cats are nice, yeah, they're especially nice.”
「あぁ、わかるぞ。言葉が通じないというのは不便だ」=“Aah, I feel that. It's really inconvenient that words can't get through to them.”
「食べるのは好きか？　あぁ、食事の量の話だぞ」=“Do you like eating? Aah, I'm mostly asking about how much you like to eat.”
「いい答えだ。なら一緒に、大盛が自慢の店に行くか」=“Nice answer. We should go to a restaurant famed for its serving sizes together sometime.”
「あぁ、私も必要なだけ食べれば十分だと思うな」=“Same, I eat only as much as I need to and consider that good enough.”
「自分で料理を作ったりするか？　美味いかは別として」=“Do you cook your own food? In general, I'm not asking if it's any good or not.”
「そうか、ちなみに私もするぞ。料理は気分転換に丁度いいからな」=“I see, I do too. It's the perfect destresser, in my opinion.”
「言えてるな。自分で作らずとも、食べる手段は幾らでもある」=“You said it. Even if you don't cook yourself, there's lots of other ways to get food.”
「運動は得意か？　体を動かすのが好き、というだけでもいいぞ」=“You good at exercise? Nothing insane, just asking if you like getting a workout, moving your body.”
「よし、いいぞ。丁度一緒にトレーニングする相手を探していたんだ」=“Alright, good. I was just looking for a training partner as it is.”
「ははっ、わかるぞ。どうにも億劫が先にくるのだろう？」=“Haha--, I get you. It always somehow starts feeling annoying right as you're about to do it, doesn't it?”
「学生の本分は勉強……おまえもそのタイプか？」=“A student's duty is to study"... Are you that type of guy too?”
「いいな、私も一緒だ。学ぶという事に無駄はないからな」=“Nice, I'm the same as you. You could never go wrong with learning even more.”
「ははっ、潔い答えだな。うん、実は私もだ！」=“Haha--, what a straight and manly reply. Yeah, the truth is, I'm the same way!”
「見た目は大事と言うが……おまえはそう思うか？」=“I think that one's appearance is important but... do you feel the same way?”
「あぁ、同意見だ。第一印象でほとんど決まってしまうからな」=“Yeah, I agree. First impressions are everything, afterall.”
「フフッ、言おうと思っていた事を、先に言われてしまったな」=“Fufu--, that's what I wanted to say, you stole my lines.”
「ふむ、まぁ、人それぞれという事にしよう……」=“Hmm, well, to each their own I suppose...”
「まず私の事を良く見ろ。話はそれからだ」=“First, take a good look at me. We can talk after that.”
「そうだ、素直に謝れる奴は嫌いじゃない。覚えておけ」=“That's right, I don't hate guys who honestly admit their fault and apologize. Remember that.”
「謝れば済むと思っているのか？　だから軽率な行動が直らないのだ」=“Do you think you can settle it all with just an apology? That's why you can't fix your rash side.”
「何だ？　何か言いたい事があるのか？」=“What? Is there something you want to say to me?”
「女の顔色を窺うな、みっともない」=“Don't try taking a peak at a girl's expression, it's shameful.”
「んぅぅ、言ってもわからない奴は、嫌われるぞ」=“Nnnn, guys who can't take a hint even when others lay everything out clearly get hated, you know?”
「おまえは見方が下手だな……露骨過ぎる」=“The way you look at things really is shit... It's way too blunt.”
「はぁ、下手なりに努力してはいるみたいだが……まったく」=“Haa, seems like you're doing your best in your own shitty way but... good grief.”
「おまえのだらしない顔……鏡に映して見せてやろうか？」=“Your disgusting expression... Want me to show you it in a mirror?”
「どこを見ている？　状況がわかっていないようだな」=“Just where are you looking? Seems like you don't understand the situation, huh?”
「んっ、どうした？　いきなり私の手に触れて……」=“Nn--, what's the matter? Touching my hand all of a sudden...”
「こらっ、いい加減にしろ。理由もなく私に触ろうとするな」=“Come on--, cut that out. Don't touch me without any reason.”
「はぁっ、節操のない……覚悟はできているのだろうな？」=“Haa--, shameless... You're prepared, for what comes next, right?”
「ほぅ……言い訳は考えてあるのか？」=“Hoh... Thinking up an excuse?”
「一時の衝動で、全て失う事もあるのだぞ？　わかっているか？」=“You can lose everything from momentary impulse, you know? Do you understand?”
「ッ、この……いいだろう……そんなに痛い目にあいたいか」=“!, this guy... alright then... you want to have a rough time, huh?”
「なっ、ど、どうした？　や、やめろっ……」=“Wha--, S-Something up? S-Stop--...”
「っくぅ……私の気が変わらないうちに……やめておけよ？」=“Kuuh... Quit it... Before I actually get angry, okay?”
「そうかそうか、忠告はしたぞ？　なら、わかっているな？」=“I see, I see, for what it's worth, I did warn you, you know? In that case, you know, right?”
「こ、このっ……いきなりどこを触って、や、やめっ……」=“T-This guy--... Just where do you think you're touching, S-Sto--...”
「はぁ、私の目を見ろ……嫌がっているのが、わからないか？」=“Haa, look at my eyes... Can you not tell, that I hate this?”
「んぅぅっ……しつこいぞ、そんなに蹴られたいか？」=“Nnnn--... Well, aren't you persistent? You wanna get kicked that badly?”
「ほぅ、これはまた……命知らずだな」=“Hoh, this is quite... Aren't you a daredevil?”
「おまえの印象が少し変わってきたか……フッ、いい方向にな」=“My impression of you has changed a bit... Pfft, in a good direction, that is.”
「さて、次はどうする？」=“Now then, what shall we do next?”
「フッ、考えろ考えろ。私の機嫌はどうやったら取れるかな？」=“Pfft, think, think. Just how are you going to butter me up today?”
「私の時間を無駄にするな。用がないなら帰るぞ」=“Don't waste my time. If there's nothing then I'm going home.”
「おまえには失望した。これを取り返すのは……難しいぞ？」=“I've lost hope in you. Making me regain it... will be an uphill battle, you know?”
「今は何を話しても無駄だ。なら、する必要もないだろう」=“No matter what we talk about now, it'll be pointless. In that case, there's no reason in continuing to do so, is there?”
「また何かあれば、遠慮なく呼んでくれ=If you ever need something else, feel free to call out to me.
「この後、時間はあるか？　もっと色々……いや、忘れろ」=“Do you have some time after this? Let's do something more... No, forget what I just said.”
「もうこんな時間か……そろそろ私は行くぞ」=“Already been this long, huh... I gotta go.”
「そうか、また話してやってもいいぞ」=“I see, feel free to chat me up again later.”
「ん？　あぁ、またな」=“Hm? Yeah, see ya.”
「よかったら一緒に帰らない？」=“If you'd like, wanna walk home together?”
「いいぞ。そんなに顔色を窺わなくても、帰るくらい付き合ってやる」=“Sure. You don't need to peek at my expression that much, I don't mind something like walking home together.”
「むぅ、悪いな。この後少し予定があるのだ」=“Muu, sorry. I have things I need to take care of.”
「一緒に勉強してみるのって、どうかな？」=“Wanna try studying together?”
「そうだな、一人より捗りそうだ。足手まといにはなるなよ？」=“Sounds good, we'll get done faster than doing it by ourselves. Don't hold me back, alright?”
「うぅむ、気分が乗らないな。今回は遠慮しておこう」=“Uumu, I'm not in the mood. I'll pass this time.”
「ねぇ、一緒に身体を動かそうよ！」=“Hey, let's get a workout together!”
「悪くない提案だな。丁度私も、そういう気分だった」=“That's not a bad idea. I was just feeling like it too.”
「いや、やめておこう。私だって、体を動かしたくない日はある」=“No, let's not. Even I have days where I don't feel like working out.”
「ちょっと付いてきてくれるかな？」=“Can I get you to come with me for a bit?”
「別に構わないが……どこへ連れていく気だ？」=“I don't particularly mind but... Where are you planning on taking me?”
「私がそんな軽い女に見えるか？　見くびられたものだ」=“Do I look like such an easy woman? Don't belittle me.”
「……まさかおまえ、妙な趣味があるのか？」=“...Wait, you got weird fetishes or something?”
「はぁぁっ、まったく……この、変態がっ！」=“Haaaa--, good grief... you damn pervert--!”
「こーら、他の奴らがいないうちに、とっとと失せろよ」=“Come on, beat it before anyone else gets here.”
「あー、失せろ痴れ者。痛い目にあいたくなければな」=“Aah, beat it, you idiot, if you know what's good for you.”
「相手の事を良く見てから話せ、おまえの目は節穴か？」=“Talk only after taking a good look at your partner. Are your eyes just a decoration?”
「なんだ。用があるなら、さっさと言え」=“What? If you need something, spit it out.”
「んぅぅ、後にしてくれ、今は時間がないんだ」=“Nnnn, hit me up later, I don't have time right now.”
「ほぉ、これは……私の体で興奮しているのか？　ん？　どうなんだ？」=“Hoh, this is... Are you getting horny from looking at my body? Hm? What's the matter?”
「ッ、このっ！　時と場所をわきまえろ！」=“!, this guy--! Know the time and place!”
「見てもいいが、感想を言えよ？　適当に答えたら……わかるな？」=“I don't mind if you look but, tell me your impressions, alright? If you give me the right answer... you get me?”
「まぁこの程度で目くじらを立てていてもな……こら、見過ぎだぞ？」=“Well, raising up a fuss for just this much would be a bit too crass too... Come on, you're staring too much.”
「はぁ～、いい空気だ。ほら、おまえも深呼吸しろ」=“Haa~, such nice air today. Come on, you take a deep breath too.”
「グラウンドを見ると、無性に走りたくならないか？」=“Doesn't looking at the ground make you just wanna go and run around?”
「こーら、鼻の下を伸ばすな。プールをそういう目で見るんじゃない」=“Come on, don't flare up your nostrils. Don't look at the pool with those eyes.”
「どうした？　何処かに行くのではないのか？」=“What's up? Shouldn't you be going somewhere?”
「待て。もし私が止めなかったら、おまえは何をするつもりだった？」=“Wait. If I didn't stop you, what exactly were you planning on doing?”
「デートの予定は覚えているな？　忘れたりしたら……フッ」=“You still remember our plans for that date, right? If you forget... Pfft.”
「んぅ？　どうした？　私に用があるのだろう？」=“Hm? What's up? You needed something from me, no?”
「女の体に興味はあるか？　いや、少し確認したかっただけだ」=“Do you have an interest in a girl's body? No, I just wanted to confirm it.”
「あっ、今は汗臭いからな……あまり近寄るな」=“Ah--, I'm really sweaty right now so... don't get too close.”
「見学なら歓迎するぞ。冷やかしなら……フッ、冗談だ」=“If you're here to check out the club, I'll welcome you. If you're here just to browse the goods... Pfft, that was a joke.”
「コイカツ部はどうした？　活動するのが恥ずかしくなったか？」=“What happened to the Koikatsu club? Ashamed to do the club activities?”
「よーし、昼だ昼だ。さて、どうするか」=“Alright, it's finally noon. Now then, what shall we do?”
「ふぅ……な、なんだ……あまり見るんじゃないっ」=“Fuu... W-What... Don't stare so much--”
「ふぁっ……こ、こらっ！　不意打ちは卑怯だぞ！」=“Fuah--... H-Hey--! Surprise attacks are dirty, you know!”
「私に用か？」=“Need something from me?”
「最近、前より優しくしてくれること、多いよね？」=“You're being a lot more nicer to me these days, I wonder why?”
「ん、まぁそうだな……だからといって、調子に乗るなよ？」=“Nnn, well, you're not wrong... That said, don't get carried away, okay?”
「いや、そうでもないぞ。思い違いじゃないのか？　フフッ」=“No, that's not true. Sure you ain't got the wrong idea? Fufu--.”
「捨て猫とか見たら、拾ってあげる？」=“If you saw an abandoned kitten, would you pick it up?”
「まぁな。見過す事もできないだろう。飼うかどうかは別として」=“Yeah. I can't exactly ignore them. Whether I'd keep them myself is another question.”
「いや、餌くらいはやってもいいが、後はそいつ次第だろう」=“No, at most I'd leave behind food, the rest would depend on the little guy itself.”
「好きな四字熟語ってある？　やっぱり、唯我独尊とか？」=“Do you have a favourite phrase? Something like "I am my own man through heaven and earth"?”
「フッ、遠回しに偉そうと言いたいのか？　だが、その通りだ」=“Pfft, trying to call me self-conceited in a roundabout way? But, yeah, I guess that one.”
「違うな、その逆だ。一視同仁、誰にでも平等に接するという事だ」=“I'd say the reverse of that. "Equality without Discrimination". Everyone deserves to be treated equally.”
「早起きは得意？」=“Ya good at getting up early?”
「あぁ、バッチリだぞ。何事もメリハリは大事だからな」=“Yeah, I wake up perfectly on time. Everything in life should be balanced.”
「苦手、だな……。どうにも朝は弱くて困る」=“Nah, pretty bad... Mornings are my kryptonite.”
「つまらん事を聞くな、他に話題はないのか？」=“Don't ask me boring stuff, do you have nothing else to talk about?”
「実は俺、超能力が使えるんだ！」=“The truth is, I have telekinesis!”
「ほーそうかそうか。凄い凄い、あー、見てみたいなー」=“Hoh, I see, I see. Amazing, Amazing. Aah, I sure wanna see it~”
「キスってやっぱり特別？」=“Do you think kisses are special?”
「それはまぁ、そうだな。お互いが想い合った結果なのだから」=“Well, yeah, I guess so. It's the result of a couple's feelings for each other, afterall.”
「そうでもない。いちいち特別視していたら、面倒だからな」=“Not really. Treating every single thing as special is a pain.”
「恋人が悪い事したら、怒る？」=“If your lover did something bad, would you get angry?”
「当たり前だ。間違いは正してやるのが、パートナーの役目だろう」=“That's obvious. It's the partner's duty, to fix their mistakes.”
「いや、怒るというか離れるな。それで気付けなければ、そこまでだ」=“No, rather than angry, I'd distance myself. And if they don't realize it, well that's as far as that goes.”
「ズバリ、結婚願望はある？」=“Essentially, do you dream of marriage?”
「なにがズバリか知らんが。人並みにはあるぞ。なんだ、悪いか？」=“I don't know what you mean by "Essentially", but, about as much as the next girl. Why, don't like it?”
「憧れよりも面倒そうな印象が強いな。女としてはどうかと思うが」=“To be honest, it sounds more like a pain than anything else. As a woman, I don't really think of it all that well.”
「恋人の過去って気にする？」=“Would you worry about your lover's past?”
「気にならないと言えば嘘になるが、それほど拘りもしないな」=“It'd be a lie to say I wouldn't but, I wouldn't get all that fixated over it.”
「フッ、後ろめたい事があるのか？　気にしないから白状してみろ」=“Pfft, is there something you're ashamed about? I don't mind so try telling me.”
「恥ずかしげもなくそういう事を聞くな。少しは考えろ」=“Don't brazenly ask me something like that. Think a bit atleast.”
「最近、夢に[H名]が出てきたんだ」=“Recently, you've been showing up in my dreams, [H名].”
「ほぅ、それで？　何をしていた？　詳しく聞かせてもらおうか」=“Hoh, and? What did you do? I'll have you tell me in extreme detail.”
「エッチな本、持ってる？」=“You got porn mags?”
「も、持っている……ぞ。い、いざという時のために予習は必要だろう……」=“I-I... do. I-It's important to be prepared, when push comes to shove...”
「例え持っていたとしても、おまえにだけは言わん」=“Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.”
「やっぱりエッチの時は攻めたい方？」=“I expect as much but, do you prefer being the top during sex?”
「や、やっぱりとはなんだ！　ま、まぁ……その通りだが……」=“W-What do you mean "I expect as much"!? B-But... yeah, I do...”
「いや、以外かもしれんが、リードされたいと思っているぞ」=“No, this might catch you by surprise but, I'd actually prefer my partner to take the lead.”
「オナニーした事ある？」=“Have you ever wanked?”
「あ、あぁ……あるぞ。私にだって、性欲くらいある……」=“Y-Yeah... I have. I have a sexual drive too...”
「な、ないぞっ！　そういうのはよくわからんからな、うん」=“N-No, I haven't--! I don't really understand much about that sort of thing, yeah.”
「男の匂いを嗅ぐと興奮する？」=“Do you get excited from smelling the scent of a man?”
「それはまぁ……する、かもな……こ、こらっ、近寄るなっ！」=“That's, well... I, might... H-Hey--, Don't come closer--!”
「ありえんな。匂いだけで興奮するなんて、変態じゃないか」=“Impossible. Getting excited just from the scent, do I look like a pervert?”
「はぁっ、おまえは下半身に脳があるのか？　呆れた奴だ」=“Haa--, you ever pull your brain out of your pants? What an exasperating guy.”
「この前さ、[H名]の事を呼びながらオナニーしてる子がいたよ」=“The other day, I saw a girl masturbating while calling out your name, [H名].”
「ま、待てっ！　とりあえず詳しく順を追って話せ！」=“W-Wait--! For now, tell me everything, in order!”
「遠回しは面倒だからな、直接聞くぞ。私ともっと近づきたいか？」=“It's a pain being roundabout, so I'll ask directly. Wanna get closer to me?”
「フッ、そうか。正直モノは得をするらしいぞ？　楽しみだな」=“Pfft, I see. I hear that honesty pays off, you know? I'm looking forward to it.”
「はぁっ、私の勘違いか……今の事は忘れろ。なるべく早くな」=“Haa--, I misunderstood, huh... Forget what we just talked about. As soon as possible.”
「おまえ、コーヒーはブラック派か？」=“Do you like your coffee black?”
「ほぅ、話がわかる奴だな。そうだ、ブラックこそコーヒーだな」=“Hoh, reasonable chap, ain'tcha? That's right, black coffee is real coffee, isn't it?”
「あぁ、賛成だ。わざわざ苦いものを飲む必要もあるまい」=“Aah, I agree. There's no point in going out of your way to drink bitter stuff.”
「辛いのは平気か？　激辛料理とか、あるだろ」=“You good with spicy food? Like, the sort of "extra spicy!" and "Hellfire!" stuff out there.”
「そうか。なら、辛さの調節できるカレー屋で、一勝負といこうじゃないか」=“I see. In that case, this calls for a bout at the local spicy curry place, don't you think?”
「わかるぞ。舌が刺激されれば美味いと勘違いしている輩が多過ぎる」=“I feel you. There's way too many people who think something tastes good just because their tongues are about to burn off.”
「甘いものは好きか？　洋菓子、和菓子、どちらでもいいぞ」=“Do you like sweet stuff? Western or Japanese sweets, either are fine.”
「あぁ、私も好きだ。今度、デザート食べ放題にでも行くか」=“Yeah, I love them too. Next time, let's go to a dessert all-you-can-eat buffet or something.”
「そうか、仲間だな。男ならまだいいが、女の私はそれだと肩身が狭くてな」=“I see, a comrade then. As a guy, you're still fine but, as a girl, it's almost something to be ashamed of, I feel like.”
「おまえ、胸の大きさはどのくらいが好みなんだ？」=“How big do you like your breasts?”
「フッ、大き過ぎても色々大変なのだぞ？　まぁ、好みだと言うなら悪くない」=“Hah, it's quite troublesome if they're too big, you know? Well, if you like them, then I suppose it's alright.”
「普通か……それは、私と同じ位と、思っていいんだな？」=“Normal ones, huh... About the same as mine, right?”
「ほぉ、珍しいな、私に気を使わなくてもいいのだぞ？」=“Hoh, I didn't expect that. You don't need to mind me, you know?”
「女の身長に好みはあるか？　高いとか、低いとか」=“Do you have any preference when it comes to a girl's height? Like, tall girls, or short girls.”
「そうか、モデルのようだと羨まれた事はあったが、おまえも好きか、フフッ」=“I see, I've had people envy me before for having a model's stature but, you like it too huh? Fufu--.”
「ここから急に変化する事はまぁないだろう。ずっとおまえの好みのままだぞ」=“I probably won't suddenly grow out within a day. I'll forever be your type.”
「それはよかった。背というのは自分でどうにかし辛いからな」=“That's great. I can't exactly change affect my own height in any meaningful way.”
「体型の好みはあるか？　女の話だぞ？」=“Do you have any preferences when it comes to figures? I'm talking about girls.”
「ほぅほぅ、そうか。なら、面倒な食事制限とはおさらばだな」=“Hohoh, I see. Then, I can finally say goodbye to the pain that is dieting.”
「普通というのは案外難しいものだ。だが、維持する意味はできたな」=“It's harder than it looks, to maintain this 'normal' form. But I'll try doing so.”
「華奢すぎると思っていたが、そこがいいと言われてはな、フフッ」=“I thought I was way too dainty, but to think you'd say you like it, Fufu--”
「そうか、まぁ参考にはさせてもらおう」=“I see, well I suppose it's good to know.”

「はぁ、まったく……次はないぞ？　よく覚えておけ」=“Haa, jeez... I won't let you off next time, okay? Remember that well.”
「考えが浅い、もう少し反省してから出直してこい」=“Your thinking is too shallow, come talk to me again after you've reflected a bit more.”
「あまり見つめるな。落ち着かないだろう」=“Don't stare too much. I can't stay calm like this.”
「言いたい事あるなら、遠慮せず言え。目で訴えるな」=“If there's something you want to say, tell me frankly. Don't pressure me with those eyes.”
「もう、なんなのだ……そ、そろそろ怒るぞ？」=“Jeez, what's with you... I-I'll get angry, you know?”
「おい、視線には気を付けろ。嫌がる女は多いぞ」=“Oi, mind your gaze. There's lots of girls who hate that.”
「私は注意したぞ？　言ってわからん奴は……どうなるかな？」=“For what it's worth, I did warn you. About what happens to guys... who don't listen to reason.”
「そうかそうか、おまえは痛いのが好きなタイプか」=“I see, I see, you're the type that likes pain, huh?”
「目は口ほどに物を言う……さて、私の目は、何と言っている？」=“They say eyes are the window to the soul... Now then, what can you see in my eyes?”
「こーらっ、親しき仲にも礼儀ありだぞっ」=“Hey--, have you never heard of "personal distance"?”
「おまえは何がしたいのだ？　面倒な事をするな」=“Just what is it that you want to do? Don't be annoying.”
「握力勝負でもしたいのか？　ん？」=“Wanna see who's grip is stronger? Hmm?”

「そのくらいにしておけよ？　引き際は大事だぞ」=“Leave it at that, alright? You should know when to quit.”
「常識的に考えろ、そう何度も触っていい場所ではないだろ！」=“Try using common sense, that's not a place you can touch however much you like!”
「んっ、なんだ……何か褒められるような事をしたか？」=“Nn--, what... did I do something worth praising?”
「こら、やめろ。変な気分になるだろうが」=“Come on, stop. I'll get into a weird mood.”
「本当に困った奴だなおまえは……ほら、そろそろ手をどけろ」=“You really are a troublesome guy... Come on, that's enough of that.”
「なっ、なんだ……い、いきなりは……驚くだろう」=“Wha--, What... D-Don't do it out of the blue like that... It's really surprising.”
「こぉらぁっ、やめろと言っている」=“Come on--, I'm telling you to cut it out.”
「むぅぅ……おまえの頬をつねってやろうか？」=“Muuu... Want me to pinch your cheeks?”
「やめろ、噛み付くぞ」=“Stop, I'll bite you.”
「おまえ、いい顔になってきたな。あぁ、悪くない」=“That's a nice expression. Yeah, it's not bad.”
「あーその、たまにはスキンシップも……大事だと思うぞ」=“Aah, uhm, I think that close physical contact is... important too.”
「フッ、このままずっと話し込んでしまいそうだな」=“Hah, we could talk for ages like this.”
「フフッ、悩め悩め。だが、あまり待たせ過ぎるなよ？」=“Fufu--, think, think. But, don't make me wait too long, alright?”
「時間の無駄だな、とりあえず出直せ」=“What a waste of time, call out to me again later instead.”
「はぁっ、私を怒らせたな……もう後悔しても遅いぞ」=“Haa--, you managed to make me mad... Even if you regret it now, it's too late, you know?”
「火に油を注ぐような真似はするな。取り返しがつかなくなるぞ」=“Don't try to add fuel to the fire. You won't be able to take it back.”
「名残惜しいが……またな」=“It's a shame to part here but... see ya later.”
「話すだけで満足できなくなったら……いつでも言え。遠慮するなよ」=“If you ever feel unsatisfied just with talking... just say the word. Don't hold back, okay?”
「ではな。おまえとの会話、少しは楽しめたぞ」=“Later then. I've started enjoying my chats with you.”
「おっと、すまん。おまえの都合を考えていなかったな」=“Oh, sorry. I didn't think about your own commitments.”
「もういいのか？　ではまたな」=“Don't want to keep chatting? Then, see ya later.”
「[H名]のことが好きなんだ」=“I love you, [H名].”
「すまん。おまえの勇気は讃えるが……気持ちには応えられない」=“Sorry. Your courage is commendable but... I can't answer to those feelings.”
「何度もごめん。[H名]のことが本当に好きなんだ」=“I'm sorry for bringing this up again and again. I really do love you, [H名].”
「フッ、懲りない奴だな。気に入った。私をもっと満足させてみろ」=“Hah, persistant, aren't you? I like that. Try satsifying me even more.”
「悪いな。まだ、おまえとそういう関係になる事は、考えられない」=“Sorry. I still can't think of myself having that sort of a relationship with you.”
「その、なんだ。私と付き合ってみないか？　悪いようにはしないぞ？」=“Uhm, Listen. Wanna try going out with me? I won't treat you badly.”
「そっ、そうか。ふぁっ……す、すまん。少し力が抜けてしまった」=“I-I see. Fuah--... S-Sorry. I just felt weak all of a sudden.”
「フッ、まぁそうなるか。今の事は忘れてくれ。その方がお互いのためだ」=“Hah, I thought you'd say that. Forget what I just said. That'd be best for the both of us.”
「迷惑かもしれんが、おまえを諦めきれない。その、私ではダメか？」=“I know it's annoying but, I really can't give up on you. Uhm, am I no good?”
「ほ、本当か？　はぁ……フフッ、諦めずに正解だったな」=“Y-You serious? Haa... Fufu--, I made the right choice by not giving up.”
「あぁ、気にするな。わかっていたさ。面倒な女で、悪かったな……」=“Yeah, don't mind it. I knew this'd happen. Sorry for being an annoying woman...”
「あのさ……[H名]とHしたいな」=“Hey, listen... I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「はぁ、もう少しよく考えろ。怒られないだけ、ありがたいと思えよ」=“Haa, think about what you say more carefully. Be grateful I'm not mad at you.”
「[H名]とHしたいな」=“I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「こら、少しは慎め。心の準備というものが……むぅぅ、やるぞ」=“Hey, crank it down a bit. My heart isn't ready... Muu, alright.”
「なっ、ダーメ―だっ！　そう気軽する事ではないだろう。まったく……」=“Wha--, we-can-not--! It's not something we can do so casually, is it? Jeez...”
「ねぇ、ここで[H名]とHしたいな」=“Hey, I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「おい、何を考えている？　んぅぅ、本当に仕方のない奴だ……」=“Oi, just what are you thinking? Nnnn, you really can't be helped...”
「待て待て待てっ！　いくらなんでも、それは無理だ。周りをよく見ろ！」=“Wait, wait, wait--! Even for us that's a bit much. Look carefully at our surroundings!”
「ここで[H名]とHしたいな」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「はぁっ、盛り過ぎだぞ？　するならその……手早くな」=“Haa--, it's a bit too much, you know? If we're going to do it, uhm... do it quickly, alright?”
「いいか、時と場所を考えろ。おまえがしたがっているのは、そういう事だ」=“Listen up, think about the time and place. The thing you want to do is just that sort of thing.”
「な、なぁ。こういうのはおかしいのかもしれないが……私と、Ｈしてみないか？」=“H-Hey. This might sound a bit strange but... Wanna try having sex?”
「よし、それでこそ男だ。据え膳は喜んで食え！　うん、いいぞ」=“Alright, that's what being a man is about. Gladly eating up the meal set in front of you! Yeah, good.”
「んまぁ、普通に考えればそうなるな……すまん、少し昂り過ぎた」=“Mm, well, that's how a normal person would react, yeah... Sorry, I got a bit carried away.”
「ねぇ、一緒にお昼食べない？」=“Hey, won't you have lunch with me?”
「あぁ、いいぞ。では、どこで何を食べるかは……決まっているか？」=“Yeah, alright. Then, the place and the menu... have you already decided on it?”
「すまん、先約がある。こう見えて私も人気者でな。また誘ってくれ」=“Sorry, I've prior plans. Despite what I may seem like, I'm a popular person too. Invite me again next time.”
「おまえ、昼は食べたか？　まだなら、一緒にどうだ？」=“Have you had lunch yet? If you haven't, how about we grab it together?”
「よし、そうこなくてはな。どこで食いたいとかはあるか？」=“Alright, that's the spirit. Got any preferences on where we do it?”
「そうか、なら日を改めよう。時間を取らせて、すまなかったな」=“I see, some other day then. Sorry for holding you up.”
「一緒にコイカツしよう」=“Let's do some love activities together.”
「別に構わんが、その名前はどうにかならないのか？　恥ずかしいぞ」=“I don't particularly mind but, can't you do something about that name? It's embarrassing.”
「悪いが他の予定がある。また今度な」=“Sorry, but I've got other plans. Some other time.”
「その、コイカツをだな……してやっても、いいぞ？」=“Uhm, you know, love activities... I don't mind, if we try some out, you know?”
「フッ、私から誘ったのだ。当たり前だなっ、フフッ」=“Hah, I'm the one who invited you, afterall, of course you'd accept--, fufu--”
「ムッ、まぁ……おまえにも予定くらい、あるだろうしな……フンッ」=“Mu--, well... I suppose you've got plans of your own... Hmph--”
「よければ、一緒に帰らない？」=“If you'd like, wanna walk home together?”
「フフッ、いいぞ。どこか寄り道していくか？」=“Fufu--, alright. Wanna stop by somewhere?”
「いや、少し残らなければいけない理由があってな。すまん」=“No, I have to stay a bit longer. Sorry.”
「あーそうだな。暇なら、一緒に帰ってやってもいいぞ？」=“Aah, listen. If you're free, I don't mind if we go home together, you know?”
「フフぅん、よしよし。では行くぞ！」=“Fufun~, good man. Then, let's go!”
「ぐっ、そうか。いや、気にするな。今は何もなかった、いいな？」=“Guh--, I see. No, don't mind it. Nothing happened between us just now, got it?”
「あのさ、もしよかったら……デートしない？」=“Hey, listen, if you'd like... Won't you go on a date with me?”
「誘われた事は素直に嬉しいが。もう少し考える時間をくれ」=“I'm glad you asked me out but, give me some more time to think about it.”
「[H名]とデートしたいんだけど……どうかな？」=“I want to go out on a date with you, [H名]... How about it?”
「いいだろう。誘ったのだから、きちんとリードしろよ？」=“Sure, why not? Since you've asked me out, you better take the lead properly, alright?”
「ん～、悪いな。少しの間、予定が詰まっているんだ」=“Nnn~, sorry. My schedule is packed for the next few days.”
「なぁ、私とデートしてみないか？　そ、損はさせないぞ？」=“Hey, wanna go on a date with me? I-I'll make sure you have a good time.”
「よしっ！　い、いや、気にするな。少し気合を入れただけだ」=“Alright--! N-No, don't mind it. I just got a bit excited.”
「そうか……これは予想以上に……いや、何でもない」=“I see... This is, unexpectedly... No, it was nothing.”
「一緒に勉強しようよ」=“Let's study together.”
「よし、いいだろう。私も復習したい所があってな」=“Alright, why not? I was just feeling like doing a review myself.”
「うーん、すまん。勉強という気分ではないな」=“Mmmm, sorry. I don't feel like studying.”
「暇なら、一緒に勉強でもどうだ？」=“If you're free, how about we study together?”
「フッ、よしよし。では、早速始めるとしよう」=“Ha, good man. Then, let's get on with it.”
「なんだと？　まぁ、仕方ないな……」=“What did you say? Well, it can't be helped...”
「おほん……おい、一緒に運動しないか？」=*ahem*... Oi, wanna get a workout together?
「フッ、私の真似をしているつもりか？　いいだろう、乗ってやる」=“Hah, trying to sound like me? Alright, I'm in.”
「私の真似なら、似てないぞ。却下だ、却下」=“If you're trying to sound like me, it ain't working. Sorry, but no.”
「おい、一緒に運動しないか？」=“Oi, wanna get a workout together?”
「よーし、いい返事だ。さて、今日は何をするか……」=“Alright, good reply. Now then, what shall we do today...”
「むっ、そうか……まぁ、気が変わったらいつでも言いに来い」=“Muh--, I see... Well, if you change your mind, just say the word.”
「[H名]はコイカツ部に興味ない？　よかったら入ってほしいな」=“Do you have any interest in the Koikatsu club, [H名]? I'd be really happy if you joined.”
「興味がないわけではないが……うーん、少し様子見だな」=“I wouldn't say I have no interest but... Well, I'll wait and see for now.”
「あー、コイカツ部、だったか？　入ってやっても……いいぞ？」=“Aah, was it called the "Koikatsu club"? I don't mind if you... sign me up, you know?”
「ちょっと付いてきてくれる？」=“Will you come with me for a bit?”
「またいきなりだな。で、何処に行くんだ？」=“Completely out of the blue again, isn't it? So, where are we going?”
「すまん、他に用事がある。また今度にしてくれるか？」=“Sorry, I have other things to do. Can we do this another time?”
「はぁ、私以外がいたら、どうするつもりだったんだ？　ん？」=“Haa, if there was someone else rather than me, what were you planning to do? Hmm?”
「フッ、いい度胸だ。後で覚えていろよ？　とりあえず出て行け」=“Hah, you've got some balls. Remember this later, alright? For now, get out of here.”
「まったく、悪戯も程々にしておけ。私まで恥をかくだろうが」=“Good grief, even pranks should have their limits. You'll make me embarrassed too.”
「あーもう知らん。私はおまえの事なんか、知らんからな」=“Aaah, I don't know anymore. I don't know you or anything about you anymore.”
「なんだ、見て分かれ。私は今、おまえと話したがっているか？」=“What, you should understand just by looking. Do I look like I want to talk to you right now?”
「さて、私は怒っているぞ。どうすればいいか、わかるな？」=“Now then, I am angry. You understand what you need to do, right?”
「すまんな。構ってやりたいが、今は時間がない」=“Sorry. I'd love to stay and chat but, I don't have the time right now.”
「はぁ、それで？　見たのだから、感想くらい言っていけ」=“Haa, so? Since you took a look, atleast tell me your impressions.”
「少し躾け直す必要がありそうだな。この、恥知らずめ」=“Looks like you need to be taught some manners. This shameless guy.”
「どうだ？　恋人の水着姿は……。惚れ直したか？」=“How is it? Seeing your lover in a swimsuit... Fell even harder for me?”
「こら、いやらしい目で見回すな。おまえは女なら誰でもいいのか？」=“Come on, don't look around with those obscene eyes. Are you fine with just any random woman?”
「私を探してここまできたんだな？　そうだろう？」=“You came all the way here because you were looking for me, right? Right?”
「よく来たな。丁度おまえが来ないかと思っていたところだ」=“Good, you're here. I was just wondering whether you would show up or not.”
「泳ぎに来たわけではないだろう？　私に逢いに来たと、照れずに言え」=“It's not like you came here to swim, right? Don't be shy and just say that you came to see me.”
「どうした？　何か気になる事でもあったか？」=“What's up? Something on your mind?”
「このスケベめ。恋人になったからといって、甘くはしないぞ」=“This pervert. Just because we're lovers doesn't mean I'll go easy on you, you know?”
「デートの準備は進んでいるか？　フフッ、楽しみだな」=“Is the prepwork for the date going well? Fufu--, I'm looking forward to it.”
「……いかんな。おまえの顔を見ると、つい頬が緩んでしまう」=“...No good. When I look at you, I find myself grinning like an idiot.”
「ほら、話すだけじゃなく。触ってもいいんだぞ？　遠慮するな」=“Come on, don't just talk to me. I don't mind if you touch me, you know? Don't hold back.”
「さて、少し休憩だ。フフッ、おまえが来たからな」=“Now then, time for a break. Fufu--, it's because you came here.”
「見学か？　それとも会いに来てくれたのか？」=“Checking out the club? Or did you come to see me?”
「部活をしていなくて丁度よかったな。おまえに使える時間が増える」=“It's a good thing I don't have to do club activities. More time to spend on you.”
「昼休みはいいな。おまえと長く一緒にいられる」=“Lunch breaks are so nice. I get to be with you for so long.”
「さて、放課後だぞ……今日はどうする？」=“Now then, school's out... What'cha doing today?”
「ひゃわっ！　こらっ、おどかすな。変な声が出ただろう」=“Hyawa--! Hey--, don't startle me. I made such a weird noise.”
「どーも、愛しの彼氏さん。フフッ、なんだ照れているのか？」=“Greetings, my beloved boyfriend. Fufu--, what are you blushing for?”
「[H名]って厳しいけど、強制はしないよね？」=“You're really strict, [H名], but you don't force others, do you?”
「まぁ、それなりの関係になったのだ。お互い対等でいたいからな」=“Well, we have that sort of a relationship. We both want to be equals to each other, afterall.”
「さぁ、どうだろうな。これからは遠慮がなくなるかもしれないぞ？」=“Who knows? I might just lose all my restraints, you know?”
「最近楽しかった事ってある？」=“Is there anything you've started enjoying recently?”
「おまえをからかっている時が一番楽しいな。フフッ、拗ねるなよ？」=“The time I spent teasing you is the most fun. Fufu--, don't sulk, alright?”
「特に無しだな。おまえにはもう少し頑張って欲しいものだ」=“Nothing in particular. I'd like you to put in more effort.”
「寝るときはパジャマ派？」=“Do you wear pajamas when sleeping?”
「あぁ、パジャマだな。今度見せてやろうか？」=“Yeah, I do. Shall I show you them next time?”
「いや、下着だけが一番多いな……フッ、今想像しただろう？」=“No, I tend to sleep in my underwear very often... Hah, you just imagined it, didn't you?”
「将来の夢ってある？」=“Got any aspirations for the future?”
「あるにはある。だが、語る程の事でもない、些細な夢だよ」=“Well, yeah, I do. But, they're nothing worth talking about.”
「お嫁さん、という柄でもないか……なんだ、残念そうな顔をするな」=“Not something like "Being a wife"... What, don't make such a disappointed face.”
「つまらん事を聞くな。そういう所、たまに抜けているなおまえは」=“Don't ask about such tedious stuff. You're really careless about that sort of stuff sometimes.”
「この前、家に白いヤモリがいてさ。縁起いいよね」=“The other day, I saw this white lizard around the house. It's a good omen, isn't it?”
「フフッ、それはよかったな。文字通り、おめでたい奴だよ」=“Fufu--, that's great. True to its name, it's an good guy to have around.”
「明日世界が滅びるって言われたら、どうする？」=“If they said the world was going to end tomorrow, what'd you do?”
「どうもしない。おまえと一緒に、ゆっくり過ごすよ」=“Nothing. I'd slowly enjoy what little time we'd have left, with you.”
「俺のこと、本当に好き？」=“Do you really love me?”
「好きだぞ。なんだ、不安にさせてしまったか？　愛しているよ」=“I do. What, did I make you uneasy? I love you from the bottom of my heart.”
「いや、嫌いだ……って、嘘だぞ？　好きだ好き。はぁ、面倒な奴だ」=“No, I hate you... Uh, that's a lie, you know? I love you, I do. Haa, what a bothersome guy.”
「俺がデートに遅れてきたら待てる？」=“Would you wait for me if I was ever late for a date?”
「連絡を寄越せば、待ってやらん事もない。私を心配させるなよ？」=“As long as you send me a message or something, I'd easily wait for you. Don't make me worried, alright?”
「いーや、待たない。私との待ち合わせに遅れてみろ、ひどい目を見るぞ」=“Nope, I won't. Just you try being late, I'll make sure you won't do it again.”
「恋人になったらやってみたかった事ってある？」=“Is there anything you've always wanted to try after you became somebody's lover?”
「あるぞ。たくさんある。少しずつで構わんから、叶えて欲しいものだな」=“There is. Lots of stuff. I don't mind if you do it slowly, as long as you make it all come true eventually.”
「そこまではないな。おまえがやりたい事に、付き合ってやるよ」=“Not really. I'll go along with anything you want to do though.”
「いつまでに結婚したい？」=“When do you want to get married?”
「今すぐと答えれば、おまえはプロポーズしてくれるのか？　ん？」=“If I said "right now", would you propose to me? Hm?”
「考えたことがなかったな……おまえが望むならいつでもいいぞ？」=“I've never really thought about it... If you want to do it, I'm ready to go at any time, you know?”
「浮かれ過ぎだ。恋人になって嬉しいのはわかるが、少しは慎め」=“You're getting too ahead of yourself. I understand that you're happy that we're dating but, tone it down a bit.”
「[H名]、好きだよ」=“I love you, [H名].”
「なっ、急にどうした？　何か頼み事か？　フフッ、言ってみろ」=“Wha--, Why all of a sudden? You want something? Fufu--, try telling me.”
「好きって１０回言い合った後にキスしよう？」=“Let's kiss after we say "I love you" to each other 10 times, alright?”
「意味がわからん……だがまぁ、どうしてもと言うなら……」=“I don't understand... But, well, if you really want to...”
「生理は重い方？」=“Are your periods rough?”
「あぁ、一日寝ていたい時もあるな。弱々しくなって困る……」=“Yeah, I have times when I just want to sleep the whole day away. I become all weak and stuff, it's really troubling...”
「それ程でもないが……イライラはする。八つ当たりしても恨むなよ」=“Not that bad but... I do get really irritable. Don't resent me if I blow up at you, alright?”
「揉まれるより乳首いじられたい派？」=“Would you rather have your nipples teased or your breasts rubbed?”
「なんだその派閥は……まぁ、気持ちいいのは……乳首だな」=“What's with those options... Well, if I had to pick... my nipples feel better.”
「揉まれる方が好きかもしれないな、ゆっくりと高まっていく感じがいい」=“I might prefer being rubbed, the slow build up is really nice.”
「お尻でしたいと思ったことある？」=“Have you ever thought of doing anal?”
「ま、まぁ、折角なら、使える所は使っておくべきだろう」=“W-Well, we ought to make use of all the places we can, no?”
「このドスケベめ。私が思っていなくても、おまえはしたいのだろう？」=“You damn pervert. Even if I've never thought of it, you want to do it, no?”
「やっぱり股間が一番感じるところ？」=“Is your crotch really your most sensitive place?”
「あ、あぁ。そういうところだからな……おいやめろ、ジロジロ見るな」=“Y-Yeah. It's that sort of place afterall... Oi, stop it, don't stare at me like that.”
「どうだろうな？　自分で確かめてみればいいんじゃないか？」=“Who knows? You just need to confirm it for yourself, no?”
「はぁ、性欲の塊だなおまえは……少しはムードも考えろ」=“Haa, you really are just a lump of lust, aren't you... Try paying attention to the mood as well.”
「俺と恋人になってから、オナニーの回数って増えた？」=“Have you started masturbating more after becoming my girlfriend?”
「何故増えると思った……ふ、増えてはいない……と思うぞ？」=“Why do you think it would increase... I-I don't think... it has?”
「[H名]もＨしたいって思う時、あるよね？」=“You have times when you want to have sex too, right, [H名]?”
「そ、それなりにはな……おまえのように無節操ではないだけだ」=“Y-Yeah, a fair bit... I'm not as much of a horny dog as you though.”
「結局、おまえは私のどこに惚れたんだ？　やはり見た目か？」=“In the end, just which part of me did you fall for the most? Is it really my appearance?”
「はぁっ、少しは気を使え。ま、そのうち全部と言わせてみせるさ」=“Haa--, be a bit more considerate. Well, I'll make you be honest soon enough.”
「フフッ、内面か……そう言うなら、見た目は好みに合わせてやろう」=“Fufu--, my insides, huh... In that case, I'll try matching my appearance to your liking.”
「なぁ、私との関係を冷やかされるのは、気にするか？」=“Hey, do you mind when people make fun of our relationship?”
「なら、その時は私に言え。二度と冷やかせないようにしてやる」=“In that case, tell me next time. I'll make sure it never happens again.”
「そうか、私と同じで良かったよ。周りなど、気にするだけ無駄だからな」=“I see, I'm glad you're the same as me. It's pointless to worry about what others think, afterall.”
「私はおまえの事を振り回し過ぎか？　その、少し気になってな」=“Do I push you around too much? That's, it's been on my mind.”
「むぅぅ、わかっているとは思うが、そういう性格なんだ。許してくれ」=“Muuu, I know you understand but, that's the sort of personality I have. Please forgive me.”
「フッ、やせ我慢はするなよ？　嫌だと思ったら、素直に言っていいからな」=“Hah, don't force yourself to be tough, alright? If you don't like it, you just need to be honest with me, okay?”
「おい、もう少しこっちに来い」=“Oi, come closer.”
「ん？　どうしたの？」=“Hm? What's up?”
「フフッ、抱き付きたくなっただけだ。どうだ、ギュっとされて嬉しいか？」=“Fufu--, I just wanted to hug you. How is it, does being hugged by me make you happy?”
「たまにはボーっとするのもいいな。おまえは退屈か？」=“Chilling out like this is nice every once in a while. Are you bored?”
「いや、いいと思う。二人でいるだけで幸せだよ」=“No, I think it's nice. I'm happy just being with you.”
「よく言う。ま、否定はしないがな……フフッ」=“You sure can talk. Well, I can't deny that either... Fufu--.”
「最近よく笑うようになったと言われたのだが、そうか？」=“I've been told that I tend to laugh and smile a lot more these days but, is that so?”
「うん、[H名]の笑顔、好きだよ」=“Yeah, I love your smile, [H名].”
「うっ、恥ずかしい事を言う奴だなおまえは……」=“Uu--, you really do love saying embarrassing stuff...”
「あー、私の胸は好きか？　大きいとか、小さいとかあるだろう？」=“Aah, do you like my chest? You should have preferences, no? Like, "Big" or "Small" or whatever.”
「そうか、文字通り手に余る程だったが、おまえが好きならいい」=“I see, they were literally too much for me to handle but, if you like them then that's fine.”
「丁度いいというのは、奇跡的なのかもな。おまえが恋人で良かったよ」=“Them being just the right size is almost a miracle. I'm glad you're my lover.”
「なら、小ぶりなりの良さを磨かなくてはな。まずは感度か？　フフッ」=“In that case, I suppose we'll just have to refine all the strong points of being small then. Should we start with sensitivity first? Fufu--”
「おまえの彼女として、私の背はどうなんだ？」=“As your girlfriend, what do you think of my height?”
「なら良かった。こればかりは縮める方が難しいからな、安心したよ」=“That's great then. It'd be much harder to shrink down, so I'm relieved.”
「めぐり合わせに感謝という所か。変に伸びないようにしないとな」=“I suppose I have to be thankful to fate then. I just have to make sure to not get weirdly tall.”
「わかっているじゃないか。小さい方がいい事だって沢山あるからな」=“Looks like you understand. There's lots of things where being shorter is more useful.”
「女のスタイルというのはやはり気になるものか？　私はどうだ？」=“Is a girl's figure something you pay attention to? How do I rank?”
「少しだらしない位がいいなんて、変わった奴だな。まぁ、私は助かるが」=“To think you like a bit of a looser girl, you're a strange guy. Well, it works out well for me.”
「現状維持が一番大変なのだぞ？　ま、惚れた弱みだ、頑張りはするが」=“Maintaining the status quo is the hardest thing ever, you know? Well, it's what you like and fell in love with, so I'll do my best.”
「細過ぎてもっと鍛えようかと思っていたが……フッ、中止だな」=“I thought I'd work a bit harder since I was too thin but... Hah, guess I'm doing no more of that.”
「……もっと素直に答えていいんだぞ？」=“...You can be honest with me, you know?”
「いいか、悪いと思っていなくてもまずは謝れ。それが誠意というものだ」=“Listen up, even if you don't think you've done anything wrong, apologize first. That's what sincerity is about.”
「あぁ、私も意固地になっていた所があった、すまなかったな」=“Yeah, I was being a bit stubborn too. Sorry.”
「反省の色が見えないな。私は逃げはしない、出直してこい」=“I can't see any signs of remorse from you. I won't run away, so think over it and come back later.”
「なんだ、にらめっこでもするか？」=“What, wanna have a staring contest?”
「しつこい奴だな。普通だったら嫌われているぞ？」=“You sure are a persistent guy. Normally, girls would have you for this, you know?”
「あぁもうっ、その辺でやめておけ。反応に困るだろう」=“Aah, jeez--. Leave it at that. I won't know how to react.”
「素直に触らせてくれと言ったらどうだ？　見ているだけでいいのか？」=“Why don't you just ask me to let you touch me? Are you satisfied with just looking?”
「わかった、おまえは見るのが好きなのだな？　私はよくわからんが」=“Got it, you like just looking, huh? I don't really get it though.”
「今度、おまえの股間をずーっと見ていてやるからな。そういう事だぞ？」=“Next time, I'll stare at your crotch the whole time. You fine with that?”
「まず私に何か言う事がある筈だが？　わからないか？」=“Shouldn't you be saying something to me first? Do you not know?”
「んっ、案外ほっとするものだな……悪くない」=“Nn--, surprisingly, that really makes my heart calm down... not bad.”
「おまえはそうしてすぐ調子に乗る。悪い癖だぞ？」=“You always get carried away like that. It's a bad habit, you know?”
「やーめーろ。次にやったら、本当に怒るからな？」=“Cut - it - out. If you do it again, I really will get mad, okay?”
「こぉらっ、わきまえろ……んっ、少しだけだぞ？」=“Come on--, this isn't the time and place... Nn--, just a little bit, okay?”
「んぅっ、少しだけと言ったぞ？　このっ、聞かん坊めっ」=“Nnnn--, I said just a little bit, you know? You--, you naughty boy--.”
「さて、ここで私が大声を上げたら……どうなると思う？」=“Now then, if I raised my voice here... What do you think will happen?”
「こらやめろ、頭を撫でるなっ。恥ずかしいだろ」=“Come on, stop, don't pat my head--. It's really embarrasing.”
「はぁ……おまえはいつもやり過ぎだ。少しは加減を覚えろ」=“Haa... you always overdo it. Learn to control yourself.”
「あぁもうしつこいっ！　頭を貸せ、私も撫で回してやる！」=“Aaah, jeez, you're too persistent--! Lend me your head, I'll rub it too!”
「んぅ？　なんだ？　私が欲しくなったか？」=“Nnn? What? You want me?”
「んっ、そう何度も触るな、色々とこそばゆくなる」=“Nn--, don't touch me there again and again, it's really ticklish, in more ways than one.”
「んぅぅ、くすぐったいと言っているだろうっ。それとも、焦らしているつもりか？」=“Nnn, I'm telling you, that's really ticklish--. You trying to tease me or something?”
「はぁっ……素直に謝れたら、ご褒美をやってもいいぞ？　どうする？」=“Haa--... If you apologize honestly, I don't mind giving you a reward, you know? What'll you do?”
「おまえといると、時間があっという間だな。フフッ、悪くない感じだ」=“When I'm with you, time just flies by. Fufu--, It doesn't feel bad.”
「んふっ、そろそろいいんじゃないか？　私は準備できているぞ？」=“Nnfu--, isn't that enough of that? I'm ready to go, you know?”
「まだまだ付き合ってもらうぞ？　私の頼みなら、断らないよな？」=“I'll have you keep me company for even longer. You won't deny request, will you?”
「そう難しく考えるな。わかっていると思うが、おまえには大分甘いぞ」=“Don't think so hard over it. You should already know but, I'm really soft on you.”
「悩んでいるなら、今すべき事を教えてやろうか？　早く謝れ」=“If you're troubled over it, shall I tell you what you need to do right now? Quickly apologize.”
「ッ、少しの間、距離を置くか……。お互い、冷静になる時間が必要だろう」=“!--, guess I'll put some distance between us for a bit... Both of us need time to cool down, no?”
「まだ話す気にはなれないな。おまえも少しは本気で考えてみてくれ」=“I still don't feel like talking with you. You should try thinking a bit seriously about it too.”
「もっと一緒にいたかったのだがな……また今度にしよう」=“I wanted to be with you for a bit longer though... Let's chat again next time.”
「むぅ、おまえのせいで体が火照ったままだ……どうしてくれる？」=“Muu, because of you, my body's burning up... What'll you do?”
「時間は残酷だな。どうにもできないというのが、もどかしい」=“Time truly is a cruel mistress, isn't it? It's really vexing, that we can't do anything about it.”
「あぁ、またいつでも話かけてくれ。待っているからな」=“Yeah, call out to me again anytime. I'll be waiting.”
「ではな、浮気はするなよ？　フフッ」=“Later then, don't fool around with other girls, alright? Fufu--”
「自分の思い通りにいかなくなったら逃げるのか？　フンッ、子供だな」=“You gonna run away just because things aren't going your way? Hmph, what a child.”
「おまえとの事を、色々考えた。結果、もう私達は別れた方がいいと思う」=“I've thought a bunch about us. In the end, I think it'd be best for us to split apart.”
「フッ、手が震えているぞ？　求められて嫌な気はしない、そう言った筈だが？」=“Hah, your hands are shaking, you know? Didn't I tell you, that I don't hate being lusted after?”
「よし、愛しの彼女からの命令だ。私とＨしろ！　……な、何か言え！」=“Alright, it's an order from your adorable girlfriend. Have sex with me!S-Say something!”
「そうだ、そうこなくてはな！　ふぅっ……よろしく頼む」=“That's the spirit! Fuu--... Take care of me.”
「グッ……なんて無様な……いっそ殺してくれ……うぅぅ……」=“Guh--... How unsightly... Just end my torment... Uuuu...”
「見せつけたくなったのか？　構わないが、私に恥をかかせるなよ？」=“Feel like making a show of it? I don't mind but, don't embarrass me, alright?”
「はぁ、愚か者め……少しは後先を考えろ。一時の感情に流されるな」=“Haa, you fool... Think about the fallout for a bit. Don't get swept away by momentary impulses.”
「ねぇ、ここで[H名]とHしたいんだけど……」=“Hey, I want to have sex with you here, [H名]...”
「この節操なしめ……いいか、少しでも物音がしたら中止だからな？」=“This horn dog... Listen up, if you make even the slighest sound, I'll ditch you here, alright?”
「こら、いきなりサカるなっ。もの欲しそうな顔をしても……ダメだからなっ」=“Come on, don't get horny all of a sudden. Even if you make that sort of desire-filled face... We can't--.”
「タイミングがいいな。丁度おまえと食べたいと思っていたところだ」=“You've got good timing. I was just thinking of grabbing food with you.”
「これから一緒に昼でもどうだ？」=“How about we grab lunch together?”
「よし、誰と食べるかは重要だからな。おまえと付き合って、それがわかったよ」=“Alright, who you eat with is important, afterall. I realized that after I started going out with you.”
「そうか、なら一人で寂しく食べるとしよう……はぁ、寂しい、寂しいな」=“I see, then I guess I'll eat all by my lonesome... Haa, I feel lonely, so lonely.”
「恋人とコイカツか、当たり前だが、誘われると嬉しいものだな」=“Love activities with your lover, it's obvious we'd do them but, it feels really nice to be asked.”
「……コイカツ、してやっても構わないが……どうする？」=“...I don't mind if we do some love activities but... what do you wanna do?”
「フフッ、私が誘ったのだから、当然の返事だな。うん、大変よろしい」=“Fufu--, I'm the one who asked, the answer was obvious. Yes, very nice.”
「彼女とコイカツをしないで、誰とするんだ？　ん？　はぁ……もういい」=“If you won't do love activities with your girlfriend, who will you do them with? Hm? Haa... whatever.”
「あぁ、もちろんだ。誘わなかったら、逆に怒っていたぞ」=“Yeah, of course. Rather, if you didn't ask me, I'd have been offended.”
「よし、帰るぞ。ほら、さっさと仕度を済ませろ」=“Alright, we're going home. Come on, wrap up your stuff.”
「フッ、遅いぞ。女を待たせるな。罰としてデザートでも奢ってもらうか？」=“Hah, you're late. Don't make a girl wait. As a punishment, shall I have you buy me some dessert?”
「まさか、一緒に帰れないのか？　ッ、そうならそうと、早く言っておけ」=“No way, are you not going to walk home withme? !--, If that's how it was going to go anyway, you should have told me sooner.”
「フフッ、断る理由はないな。楽しみが一つ増えたよ」=“Fufu--, I don't have a reason to refuse. Yet another thing I'm looking forward to.”
「こ、光栄に思え。おまえをその……で、デートに誘ってやる！」=“T-Take it as an honour. I've come to, uhm... i-invite you to date!”
「いよしっ！　最高のデートにしてやるからな。覚悟しておけ！」=“Alright--! I'll make it the best date you've ever had, so be prepared!”
「うっ、すまん。その……無駄に偉そうだったのは謝るから……ダメか？」=“Uu--, Sorry. Uhm... I'll apologize for putting on airs... Can we really not go?”
「真面目ぶって何が狙いだ？　ん？　正直に言ってみろ」=“What are you aiming for, trying to look all serious and stuff? Hmm? Try telling me honestly.”
「少し、一緒に勉強するというのはどうだ？　わからない所があってな」=“How about we study together for a bit? I've something I need your help with.”
「良かった。わからない事をそのままにするのは、よくないからなっ」=“Great. It's not good to leave things you don't know unsolved, after all--.”
「そうか、では一人でやるとしよう……一人で寂しくな、フンッ」=“I see, then I'll just do it by my lonesome... By myself, all lonely, hmph.”
「別に構わないが……変な所に触ったら怒るぞ？」=“I don't particularly mind but... If you touch me in weird places, I'll get mad, okay?”
「よし、私が鍛え直してやる。一緒に来い！」=“Alright, I'll re-train you. Come with me!”
「フフッ、本気でやれよ？　頑張ったらご褒美があるかもしれないぞ？」=“Fufu--, do it seriously, alright? If you do your best, there just might be a reward at the end, you know?”
「残念だな。最後には気持ちのいい運動もあったのだが……はぁ、残念だ」=“Shame. I was thinking of doing some pleasure-filled exercises with you at the end there but... Haa, what a shame.”
「ちょっと、付いてきて欲しいな」=“I want you to follow me for a bit.”
「いいぞ。どこへなりとも、連れて行け」=“Alright. Take me wherever you want.”
「却下だ。今は一緒にいたくない」=“No. I don't want to be with you right now.”
「あぁ」「そうだな」「いいぞ」「悪くない」「いいだろう」=[Yeah] [Indeed] [Sure] [Not bad] [Why not?]
「いや」「それは無い」「ダメだ」「却下」「やめておけ」=[No] [That's not true] [Don't] [I'll pass] [Stop it]
「ほぉ」「ほぅ」「フッ」「そうか」「ふぅん」=[Hoh] [Hoh] [Hah] [I see] [Hmm]
「なっ！」「はぁっ！」「ひゃぁ！」「ふぁっ！」「んぇっ！」=[Wha--!] [Haa--!] [Hyaa--!] [Fuah--!] [Nneh--!]
「おぉ」「いいな」「よしっ」「フフフッ」「うんうん」=[Ooh] [Nice] [Alright--] [Fufufu--] [Yeah, yeah!]
「チッ」「フンッ」「むぅぅ」「なんだと」「はぁっ」=[Tsk--] [Hmph--] [Muuu] [What'd you say?!] [Haa--]
「んぅぅ」「ふぅっ」「ぁぁ……」「まったく……」=[Nnn] [Fuu--] [Aah...] [Jeez...]
「フフッ」「ハッ」「んふぅっ」「んぅふふっ」「フフーン」=[Fufu--] [Ha--] [Nnfuu--] [Nnfufu--] [Fufuunn]
「こ、こらっ」「やめっ」「んゃっ」「むぅぅっ」「このヘンタイッ」=[H-Hey--] [Sto--] [Nnya--] [Muu--] [You pervert--]
「なぁ」「おい」「そうだ」「あー」「さて」=[Hey] [Oi] [That's right] [Aah] [Now then]
「ねぇ……[Hあだ名]」=“Hey... [Hあだ名].”
「ど、どうした？　[Pあだ名]……フフッ、お互い慣れないな」=“W-What's up? [Pあだ名]... Fufu--, Neither of us are getting used to it.”
「そんな風に気安く呼ぶな。今はそういう気分ではない」=“Don't call me that so carefreely. I'm not in the mood.”
「あー……[Pあだ名]」=“Aah... [Pあだ名].”
「ん？　どうしたの？　[Hあだ名]」=“Hm? What's the matter? [Hあだ名].”
「よ、呼んでみただけという奴だ……他意はないぞ」=“J-Just felt like calling out to you like that... I didn't mean anything bad.”
「フッ、いいだろう。私を満足させろよ？　[Pあだ名]」=“Hah, alright. Make sure to satisfy me, alright? [Pあだ名].”
「なぁ、私とＨしたいだろぉ？　ほら、我慢するなよ、 [Pあだ名]」=“Hey, you wanna have sex with me, no? Come on, don't endure it, [Pあだ名].”
「なぁ、少し話でもしないか？」=“Hey, won't you chat with me for a bit?”
「なぁ、[Pあだ名]。少し話でもしないか？」=“Hey, [Pあだ名]. Won't you chat with me for a bit?”
「入部してくれるの？　大歓迎だよ！」=“You're gonna join the club? I'll welcome you!”
「フフッ、そうか。では、よろしく頼むぞ」=“Fufu--, I see. Then, take care of me.”
