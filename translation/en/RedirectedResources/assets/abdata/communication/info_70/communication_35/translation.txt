「な、なんでこげんところにおると！？　ここ女子トイレよ！？」=“W-Why are you in a place like this!? This is the girls' toilet, you know?!”
「な、なんしよーと！？　男子は入っちゃいかんってば！」=“W-What are you doing!? Boys shouldn't be going in here!”
「なん？　今忙しいっちゃけど？」=“What? I'm busy right now.”
「……なんなん？」=“...What?”
「ごめん、今ね、ちょっと時間ないっちゃん」=“Sorry, I don't have all that much time right now.”
「むにゅ……んん……もうすぐ、お祭りやけん……むにゃ……」=*munyuu*... nnn... the festival, is almost about to start... *munyaa*...
「わぁっ、こげなとこ見らんどって！　恥ずかしいって！」=“Waah--, don't look at me right now! It's really embarrassing!”
「うぅ……や、やっぱり男子に見られるのは恥ずかしい……」=“Uuu... I-It really is embarrassing, to be seen by a boy like this...”
「はぁぁ……この向こうに私の故郷があるっちゃんね……って、冗談よ？」=“Haa... there's my hometown in here, you see... that was a joke, you know?”
「あ、君も本借りに来たと？　私はね、勉強しに来たとよ。標準語の。……じょ、冗談やけんね？」=“Ah, did you come to get a book issued too? I came here to study. Standard Japanese, that is. ...T-That's just a joke, okay?”
「この学園って教室綺麗やよね。みんな真面目にお掃除しとうっちゃね」=“The classrooms in this school are really clean, don't you think? Everyone is so earnest about the cleanup.”
「あははっ、どこに連れていってもらえるとかいな」=“Ahaha--, where are you gonna take me?”
「いやいや、さすがにそこは無理やけん！　冗談やろ？」=“No no, we really can't do that! You're joking, right?”
「あはっ、君と一緒だとなーんか楽しいっちゃけど」=“Aha--, being with you is really fun.”
「こう見えて……男の子と話すのって……結構緊張するとよ？」=“As you can see... talking with a boy is... it's pretty nerveracking, you know?”
「あはっ、もし良かったら君も一緒に身体動かしてみらんね？」=“Aha--, if you like, why don't you try getting some exercise with me?”
「ん？　どうしたん？　もしかしてうちの部活も気になっとうと？」=“Hm? What's the matter? Are you curious about our club's activities?”
「コイカツ部も大変そうやね。部長さん、頑張って！」=“The Koikatsu Club looks pretty hard to manage too. Do your best, Club President!”
「はぁぁ、やっとお昼……でもお腹空いとっても、あんまり食べると体重が気になるっちゃんね」=“Haa, it's finally lunch time... But, even if I'm starving, if I eat too much, I'm gonna start putting on pounds.”
「ふぅ……今日も楽しい一日やったよー」=“Fuu... today was a great day too.”
「なんっ！？　あっ、君……あはは、びっくりしたやんもー！」=“Wha--!? Ah--, it's you... ahaha, you surprised me, jeez!”
「ん？　どーしたと？」=“Hm? What's the matter?”
「やっぱり前に住んでたところの方が暮らしやすい？」=“Was your daily life easier back where you're from?”
「うん……慣れもあるっちゃろうけど。でもでも、こっちにもすぐ慣れるけんね」=“Yeah... I was used to it, afterall. But, that's not to say I can't used to living here.”
「あはは、もうこっちに馴染んどうけん。こっちの方が好きよ。私、薄情なんかいな？」=“Ahaha, I've already gotten used to life here. I like it here better. Do you think that makes me heartless?”
「こっちに来て何か美味しい物とか見つけた？」=“Have you found something particularly delicious, having come to this city?”
「駅にあるベイクドチーズケーキのお店！　あれ、ばり美味しいけん、全国展開して欲しい！」=“Yes, the baked cheesecake from the store at the station! That thing is really amazing, I want it to become a nationwide sensation!”
「ううん、まだそげん見て回ってないとよ。でも色んなお店がありそうやけん、楽しみ！」=“No, I haven't gotten the chance to look around that much. But, there are lots of stores in this city, so I'm looking forward to visiting them all!”
「俺、方言ってすごく可愛くていいと思うんだけど、自分ではどう？」=“I personally think your dialect is super cute but, what are your own thoughts on it?”
「生まれた場所の言葉やけん、もちろん好いとうよ。でも少しずつこっちの言葉に慣れんといかんね」=“It's the language of the place I've lived most of my life in, so of course I love it. But, that doesn't mean I can slack off on learning how they speak here.”
「本当はちょっと恥ずかしいっちゃん。外で話すとみんなから見られるっちゃもん」=“It's actually something I'm embarrassed about. Whenever I speak outdoors, everyone just kinda stares at me.”
「えーっと……今はそげんことよりも別のこと話そ？」=“Erhm... let's talk about something else for now, okay?”
「こっちに来て驚いたことってある？」=“Has anything caught you by surprise, having come here?”
「もう驚くことばっかりよ！　やっぱり全然違うけんね～」=“It's been nothing but surprises! It really is a completely different place~”
「今朝、ものすごい数の犬を散歩させてる人がいたんだよ」=“This morning, I saw a person walking around an absolutely incredibly number of dogs.”
「えぇ、どのくらい！？　ちょっと見てみたい！」=“Eeh, how many!? I wanna see!”
「昨日の夜、うちの前で野良猫が集会しててさ」=“Last night, there were a bunch of stray cats having their gathering in front of my house.”
「わぁ、猫の集会って本当にあるんやね！」=“Waa, cats really do have gatherings, huh!”
「前に住んでたところの男子とこっちの男子、やっぱり性格とか違うの？」=“Have you noticed any differences in temperament and personality between boys here and boys back where you're from?”
「そうやねぇ……多分違うと思うっちゃけど、私……あんまり男友達おらんかったけん、よく分からんっちゃん」=“That's a good question... They probably do have differences but I... didn't really have all that many guy friends so, I don't really know.”
「どうなんやろ？　男の人にも色んなタイプの人がおるけんね」=“Who knows? There's all kinds of boys out there afterall.”
「周りの子ってみんな恋人いたりする？」=“Did the girls around you all have boyfriends?”
「前の学園の娘は結構恋愛しとったかも……あ、でも……私はおらんかったよー」=“I think they did at my previous school... Ah, but... I didn't, just so you know.”
「それが意外と少ないとよ。恋愛の話はよくするけど、みんな憧れ止まりやけん」=“Unexpectedly, it was very uncommon. Everyone loved to talk about romance but, it didn't really go much past longing for love.”
「好きな男性のタイプってある？」=“Do you have a type, in terms of boys you like?”
「純朴で優しい人がいいっちゃけど……あはは、ごめん、ふわっとしすぎやね」=“I think the simple and sweet sort are the best... Ahaha, sorry, that's way too wishy-washy, isn't it?”
「タイプっていうか、男の子の知り合い自体が少ないけん……ちょっとまだ分からんかも」=“Forget type, I don't even know all that many boys to begin with... so I don't really know still.”
「こ、こげな話しとったら……ちょっと照れる……他のこと話そ？」=“T-This sort of topic... is really embarrassing... can we talk about something else?”
「色々聞きたいことはあるんだけど……うーん、これは少し恥ずかしいからやめておこうかな」=“There's something I'm really curious about... Well, it's a bit embarrassing so nevermind.”
「ふぇぇっ！？　い、一体何聞くつもりやったん！？」=“Fueeeh--!? J-Just what where you planning on asking me!?”
「コイカツ部ってなんだか範囲が広すぎるよね」=“The scope of the Koikatsu club is kinda way too big, don't you think?”
「そうやねぇ。コイカツ自体、人それぞれで違うもんね」=“Yah. The idea of romance itself differs from person to person, afterall.”
「実はこの間、再放送ですごい恋愛ドラマ見てさ……」=“Actually, the other day, I saw this amazing romance TV drama rerun...”
「あっ、知っとる知っとる！　私、それリアルタイムで見とったよ！　感動するよね！」=“Ah--, I know of that one! I saw it when it was airing! It was really moving, wasn't it?”
「積極的な男性とかどうかな？」=“You like assertive boys?”
「私は好きよ。ぐいぐい引っ張ってくれる人って格好良いやん！」=“I do. Guys who pull you up close to them are really cool!”
「うーん、ペースを合わせてくれる人がいいかも」=“Well, I'd actually prefer guys who'd try to match my pace instead.”
「慎重な男性とかどうかな？」=“Opinions on careful, prudent guys?”
「いいと思うよ。行き当たりばったりな人より絶対いいやん」=“I think they're nice. Much better than guys who just wing everything for sure.”
「時には勢いも大事やけん。あんまり慎重すぎるのはちょっと……」=“Momentum and vigour is important too sometimes. Going overboard on prudence is...”
「勤勉な男性とかどうかな？」=“What do you think of dilligent guys?”
「真面目ってことやろ？　男の子に限らず、真面目な人って信用出来るし、好きよ」=“You mean the serious, earnest types, right? Rather than just boys, I like dilligent people in general, they're really reliable.”
「苦手かも……私がこんな性格やけん、一緒にハメを外してくれる人がいいっちゃん」=“I'm not all that good with them... You know the sort of girl I am, I'd prefer a guy who wouldn't mind cutting loose with me.”
「マイペースな男性とかどうかな？」=“What do you think of guys who go at their own pace?”
「いいっちゃない？　ある意味、何事にも動じんってことやろ？　それってめっちゃ長所やん」=“They're fine, no? In a way, they're an unruffled sort, no? I think that's a really good trait to have.”
「一人ですたすた行っちゃいそうな感じで……私、結構苦手っちゃんね」=“It feels like they'll just keep going on and on, even if they're alone... I can't really handle that.”
「優しい男性とかどうかな？」=“What do you think of kind and gentle guys?”
「うん、いいと思うよ。やっぱり何よりも優しさが一番よ」=“I think they're nice. In my books, kindness is everything.”
「悪くないと思うけど……優しい人って大体優柔不断なんよね……それが苦手かも……」=“I don't think they're bad but... those sorts of people are mostly just shilly-shally, don't you think?... they're not for me...”
「クールな男性とかどうかな？」=“What do you think of the cool sorts of guys?”
「ばり格好いいよね。そういう人、憧れるなぁ」=“They're super cool. Man, I really like those sorts of guys.”
「クールな人って無口やけん嫌いかも」=“They don't really talk with their words so I kinda hate them.”
「あのさ、エッチなことって……前住んでたところの方が進んでた？」=“Hey, I've got a question, lewd stuff... did people do it more often where you used to live?”
「え、えっと……うん……何人かは……そういうことしてる娘もおったよ」=“E-Erhm... yeah... there were quite a few girls... who used to do it.”
「やっ、えっ、えっとっ……ごめん、私自身、そういう話あんまりせんかったけんっ！」=“T--, E-Erhm--... Sorry, I didn't really, ask about that sort of stuff before--!”
「正直なところ、エッチなことって興味ある？」=“Be frank, do you have any interest in sex?”
「うぅぅ……そ、それは真面目に答えないかんと？　あるかないかで言えば……あるけど……うぅぅ……」=“Uuu... d-do I really have to answer that seriously? If I had to say... I do, but... uuu...”
「全くないよ♪　本当！　本当にないとよ！　本当やけんね！」=“Not at all♪ It's true! I really don't! It's the absolute truth!”
「友達がどんなエッチしてるか……聞いたりする？」=“Do you ever ask your friends... just what sort of lewdness they get up to?”
「い、一応はね……あ、でも教えんよ！？」=“F-For what it's worth, I do... ah, but I'm not telling you, okay?!”
「き、聞くわけないってー。そげん恥ずかしいこと。もー！」=“O-Of course I don't! Something that embarrassing. Jeez!”
「こ、こげな話はやめよ？　恥ずかしくてほっぺた熱くなるやん」=“L-Let's not talk about this, okay? It's so embarrassing, my cheeks are going to burn up.”
「この間読んだエロ本がすごくてさ……」=“This hentai doujin I was reading the other day was just so good...”
「待って待って！　それ普通に女子に話す内容なん！？」=“Wait, wait! Is that something you should really be talking to a girl about!?”
「俺、実はエッチにすっごく興味があって……」=“The truth is, I'm really interested in lewd stuff...”
「お、男の子やから普通やとは思うけどっ……それを私に告白してどうするん！？」=“S-Since you're a boy, I think that's normal but--... why are you confessing that to me!?”
「この間さ、ネットですごい内容の体験談見つけたんだよね」=“The other day, I read about someone's amazing personal experience on the net.”
「う、わぁ……気になる……気になるけど……聞いたらエッチな娘やって思われる……」=“U--, wah... I'm curious... I'm curious but... you'll think I'm a lewd girl if I ask about it...”
「私……方言だけやなくて、考え方も田舎っぽいかいな……」=“Rather than just my way of speaking... is my way of thinking too small town too...”
「うぅ……やっぱり……でもそういう風に思ってもらえるならいいかも」=“Uuu... so I was right... but if you feel that way then I suppose it's fine.”
「そうよね！　良かったー。せめて考え方は同年代の人と一緒がいいもん」=“Right! I'm glad. It's great that atleast I think the same way as others of my age.”
「うそっ、なんで答えてくれんと！？　私、変なこと聞いた？」=“No way--, why won't you answer!? Did I ask something weird?”
「あのね、君って動物は好きなん？」=“Hey, do you like animals?”
「あはは、私も！　犬派も猫派もなく全部好き！　爬虫類も好きなんよ」=“Ahaha, me too! Not just cats or dogs, I love them all! Even reptiles!”
「あ、良かった、同じー。見てるだけならいいけど、近くに行くのはちょっと怖いん」=“Ah, great. Same here. Just looking at them is fine enough but, getting close to them is a bit scary.”
「男の子やけん、君もやっぱりたくさん食べると？」=“You're a guy in the end, so do you eat lots too?”
「あ、やっぱりー。実は私も結構食べるっちゃん。女子やけどね！」=“Ah, I knew it. I eat a lot too myself. I'm a girl though!”
「えー、そうなん？　私と同じやね。二人で外食したらたくさん残しそう」=“Eh, that so? Same as me then. Feel like if we went out to eat together, there'll be lots of leftovers.”
「何となくやけど、君って料理上手そうよね。自分で作ったりするん？」=“It's a bit random but, you look like you're pretty good at cooking. Do you cook your own food?”
「さすが一人暮らしやね！　私もお手伝いで作ったりはするよ」=“You live alone afterall! I help out with dinner myself too.”
「わわ、逆に意外ー。え？　私？　私は見たまま……料理なんて出来んよ？　あ、あははー、意外でも何でもなかろ？」=“Wawah, I didn't really expect that. Eh? Me? As you'd imagine... I can't cook at all, you know? A-Ahaha, even it's surprising, does it really matter?”
「ねぇ、君ってさ、運動って得意なん？」=“Hey, are you like, any good at physical stuff?”
「おお、私と同じやん！　身体動かすのって気持ちいいもんね！」=“Oooh, same as me! Getting a workout feels amazing, doesn't it!”
「お仲間がおった！　えへへ、私も苦手なんよ。小さい頃からずっとなん。なんでやろうね」=“My comrade! Ehehe, I'm bad at it too. Have been bad since I was a child. I wonder why?”
「君は勉強ってきちんとしとる？」=“Do you take your studies seriously?”
「さすがやん！　私も予習復習はやっとるよ。日々の努力が大事やもんね」=“Awesome! I do reviews everyday too! Chipping at it day by day is important.”
「そうそう、やる時間なんてないよねー。とか言っとったらいかんのは分かっとうっちゃけどね……」=“Exactly, there's just no time to do it. Though, saying it like that makes me feel pretty guilty though...”
「君って休みの日とかはお洒落する人なん？」=“Are you the type of person to dress up fashionably on your days off?”
「わぁ、いいね。私も洋服好きなんよ。お気に入りの服着るとテンション上がるもんね」=“Waah, that's nice. I like western clothes too. It really makes me feel like I'm at the top of the world, when I wear clothes that I like.”
「あ、分かるー……こういうのって意外と面倒やもんね」=“Ah, I feel you... It's actually quite the pain to keep track of fashion, isn't it?”
「あ、そっかー。私とは正反対なんやね」=“Ah, I see. The complete exact opposite of me, huh?”
「そげんことより……もっと大切な話があるっちゃないと？」=“Rather than that... isn't there something more important that you should be saying to me?”
「あはは、ごめん……私、怒りすぎとったみたい……自分でも反省しとるよ」=“Ahaha, sorry... I got a bit too angry there... I'm reflecting on it too.”
「むぅぅ……そ、そう簡単には許さんもん！　本当に怒っとるっちゃけんね」=“Muuu... I-I won't forgive you that easily! I really am mad, you know?”
「どうしたと？　顔、気になるん？」=“What's the matter? Something on my face?”
「えー、なになに？　そんなに見られると私まで気になるっちゃけど」=“Eeh, what's up? If you stare at me so hard, I'll get curious too.”
「もー、見すぎやって！　恥ずかしいけんやめて？」=“Jeez, you're staring too much! It's embarrassing so cut it out, please?”
「ふぁっ……も、もしかして今、む、胸っ……見たやろ！？」=“Fuah--... J-Just now, y-you looked at my chest--... right!?”
「そういうとこじろじろ見ちゃいかんって！　それとも男の子ってみんなそーなん？」=“Don't stare so hard at that! Are all guys like that?”
「うぅぅ……な、なんか怖くなってきた……君、そーいう人なん……？」=“Uuu... I-I'm starting to get scared... Were you that sort of a person...?”
「……今、私がどういう気持ちか分からんと？」=“...Can't you tell how I feel?”
「ふぁっ！？　い、いきなりどーしたん！？」=“Fuah--!? W-What's gotten into you!?”
「ひぅっ……て、手っ、触られるのってっ……結構抵抗あるんやけど……」=“Hyu--... I-I don't particularly like--... having my hand touched...”
「だからいかんってばー！　距離感近すぎやけん！」=“I'm telling you, stop! You're getting way too into my personal space!”
「えっ……えっ！？　い、今の……さすがにわざとじゃないっちゃろ？」=“Eh--... Eh--!? T-That just now... tell me it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't, right?”
「きゃっ！　も、もーっ！　絶対わざと触っとるやんっ！　信じられんっちゃけど！」=“Kyah--! J-Jeez--! You're definitely touching me on purpose--! I can't believe it!”
「完全にセクハラやけんね？　さすがの私でも怒るよ？」=“This is completely sexual harrassment, you know? Even I'm bound to get angry, you know?”
「わふっ……あ、あははっ、変な声出た……」=“Wafuh--... A-Ahaha--, I made a weird sound...”
「やっ……わっ……ふああっ……だから変な声出るって！」=“Na--... wah--... Fuaah--... Stop, you're making me make weird noises!”
「ふやぅっ！　こ、こーらー、もうダメ！　これ以上は怒るけんね？」=“Fuyauu--! H-Hey, leave it at that! Any more and I'll get mad, okay?”
「ひゃんっ！　なに？　何か気になるものでもあったと？」=“Hyaan--! What? Was there something you were curious about?”
「もしかして感触楽しんどるやろ？　い、いくら私がぷにぷにやからって……もぅ……」=“By any chance, are you savouring the feel of them? J-Just because they're really soft, doesn't mean... jeez...”
「やーん、もう限界！　これ以上ぷにぷにしたら、私、爆発するけんね！」=“No, I'm at my limit! If you squish them any more, I'll blow up, so you know!”
「今そげんことするとか……ちょっと有り得んっちゃない？」=“Doing something like that right now... Don't you think it's a bit much?”
「こんな感じで、もっともっと君と親しくなれたら嬉しいなぁ」=“Would be so nice if we could just keep getting closer and closer like this.”
「えへへ、何の話しよっかなぁ」=“Ehehe, what should we talk about?”
「男の子とお話するのって楽しいんやねー」=“Chatting with a boy is really fun~”
「用事ないならもう行くけんね。いいと？」=“If you don't need anything, I'mma go. Okay?”
「……話す気分やなくなったかも。じゃあね」=“...I don't really feel like talking anymore. Bye.”
「これ以上は無駄な時間になりそうやけん、それじゃあ」=“Any more than this would just be a waste of time, so I'mma be off.”
「あー、もう行かないかん……楽しい時間ってあっと言う間やね。また色々話聞かせてね」=“Ah, I really have to go... time sure flies by when you're having fun. Talk to me about lots more stuff later, kay?”
「はぅ、私、そろそろ行かんと……男の子と話すのって、緊張するかと思ったけど……楽しかったよ。相手が君やけんかも♪」=“Hauu, I really gotta go... I thought I'd feel really tense, talking to a boy, but... it was fun. Maybe because it's you♪”
「あ、私そろそろ行くね」=“Ah, I gotta go.”
「うん、それじゃまた。これからもいっぱいお話してね」=“Yeah, till next time. Talk to me lots in the future too.”
「はーい」=“Yes.”
「よかったら一緒に帰らない？」=“If you'd like, wanna walk home together?”
「うん、いいよ！　君と帰るの楽しいっちゃもん」=“Yeah, alright! Walking home with you is really fun.”
「あっ、ごめん、今日は無理なんよ。また今度誘ってね」=“Ah--, sorry, I can't today. Invite me out next time, okay?”
「よかったら一緒に勉強しない？」=“If you'd like, wanna study together?”
「わっ、助かるかも！　ちょうど教えてもらいたいところがあったっちゃん！」=“Wah--, that'd really help me out! I'm stuck on a problem that I'd really like help with!”
「今日は先約があるとよ……ごめんね」=“I already have plans with a friend today... Sorry.”
「一緒に身体を動かさない？」=“Wanna get a workout together?”
「いいよ！　賛成！　たまに汗かきたい時ってあるけんね！」=“Sure! I'm all for it! There are times when you just really want to get a good sweat going, don't you think!”
「今日はね……ちょっと体調が……だけん、また今度ね」=“Today's a bit... I don't feel good... some other time, okay?”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Could I get you to follow me for a bit?”
「なになにどーしたと？」=“What, something the matter?”
「あっ、今は無理かも……友達が待っとうとよ」=“Ah--, I can't right now... My friends are waiting on me.”
「も、もーっ、なんで普通に入ってこれるん？　ここ、女子トイレってわかっとっちゃろ？」=“J-Jeez--, why are you entering this place like it's nothing? You should know that this is the girls' toilet, right?”
「きゃーっ！　なんしよん！？　ほらほら、はよ出て！」=“Kyaa--! What are you doing!? Go, leave quickly!”
「ひゃっ！　な、なんで入ってきたん？　もしも人がおったら大変やったよ？」=“Hyaa--! W-Why did you come in here? If there were others in here, it'd have been a real pickle, you know?”
「こんなところに来たらいかんって！　男子禁制やけん。ほら、出て出て！」=“You really shouldn't come in here! Boys aren't allowed in here. Go on, get out!”
「もー……なんなん？　今、時間あんまりないけん。後からにして」=“Jeez... What is it? I don't have time right now. Save it for later.”
「はぁぁ……なに？」=“Haaa... What?”
「ごめん、ゆっくりしたいけど、あんまり時間ないっちゃん。ホント、ごめんね」=“Sorry, I want to take the time to chat with you, I do, but I don't have time. I'm really sorry.”
「ひあっ……な、なんで見るん？　いくら君相手でも……この姿は恥ずいって」=“Hyaa--... W-Why are you looking? Even if its you... It's really embarrassing.”
「なっ……こんなとこ見たらいかんよ！　なんでって……恥ずかしいけんに決まっとろーもん！」=“Wha--... You shouldn't see me like this! Why, you ask... It's because it's embarrassing, you dolt!”
「み、水着……変やない？　君の前やけん……ちょっと緊張する……」=“M-My swimsuit... it's not weird, right? I'm a bit nervous... because I'm in front of you...”
「ただ水着なだけなんに……男の子に見られとうって思ったら……恥ずかしいね」=“Even though it's just a swimsuit... when I think about how a boy is watching me... it feels embarrassing.”
「あ、君も来たん？　風があって気持ちいいけん、一緒にあたろ」=“Ah, you came here too? The air feels really nice so, let's hang around together.”
「ここ、静かで好きなんやけど……ふぁぁ……今日も眠くなってきたん……」=“I love this place, it's so nice and quiet but... fuaah... I'm starting to feel sleepy today too...”
「教室って落ち着くんよね。なんかさ、青春って感じ……するやん？」=“Man, classrooms are so calming. It feels like, youth, I guess... you feel me?”
「ふふっ、ちゃんと付いていきよーよ」=“Fufu--, I'll go with you.”
「ちょっと待って！　さすがにそこは良くないって」=“Wait just a moment! We really can't go in there.”
「ふふっ、君とのデート……どんどん近くなる……楽しみで眠れんとよ？」=“Fufu--, our date together... it's getting closer and closer... I'm so excited, I haven't been sleeping much, you know?”
「ん？　なに？　またいっぱいお話してくれるん？」=“Hm? What? Gonna chat with me lots again?”
「君と話しとったらね……私、自分のこと女子なんやなーって思うよ。あ、べ、別に深い意味はないっちゃけど！」=“Whenever I talk to you... I really do feel like a girl. Ah, t-there's no deep meaning behind that, so you know!”
「えへへ、見てくれとった？　今日は結構頑張っとうとよー」=“Ehehe, did you see? I've been doing my best today.”
「たまにはうちの部にも参加してみる？　意外とハマるかもしれんやん？」=“Wanna try participating in our club activities sometime? You might be more into it than you'd expect, you know?”
「コイカツ部、頑張ってね！」=“Work hard at the Koikatsu club!”
「ふぅ……君はお昼もコイカツしてると？」=“Fuu... do you do your club's activities even during lunch time?”
「今日も一日お疲れさまっ！　私も頑張ったけん、ほめてほめて～」=“Good work today too--! I did my best too, so praise me, praise me~”
「ひゃっ！　もー、気付かんかった！　あはは、おるならおるって言ってよー」=“Hyah--! Jeez, I didn't notice you! Ahaha, if you're nearby, atleast let me know~”
「なぁん？　どーしたと？」=“What? Something up?”
「俺が言うのもアレだけどさ、結構親しみやすい性格って言われない？」=“It doesn't exactly sound like much coming from me but, do people ever tell you that you're really easy to talk to?”
「うん、言われるよー。方言のせいかいな？　それとももともとそういう性格なんかなぁ」=“Yeah, they do. I wonder if it's because of my dialect? Or if it's because I've got that sort of a personality to begin with.”
「うーん、こう見えて私、実は人見知りなんよ……君となら気楽に話せるっちゃけどね」=“Well, I may seem like this but, I actually have lots of social anxiety, you know... I really feel at ease chatting with you though.”
「早起きとか得意？」=“Are you good at getting up early?”
「うん、得意得意！　前の学園の頃なんて、今よりめっちゃ早かったとよー」=“Yeah, I am! Back when I was at my old school, I used to get up even earlier, you know~”
「一番苦手なことかもしれん……だって……つい夜更かしするっちゃもん……」=“It might just be my biggest weakness... I can't help it... I find myself staying up late almost everyday...”
「家にいる時、ニュースとか結構見る？」=“When you're at home, do you watch the news often?”
「見る見る。政治のこととかスポーツのこととか、色々気になるけんね」=“I do. I'm pretty interested in things like sports and politics.”
「あんまり見とらんねぇ……ニュースの時間は他のことしとるけん」=“Not really... I usually spend my time doing other stuff instead.”
「文房具とか凝っちゃうタイプ？」=“Are you the type to get really absorbed in things like stationary?”
「よく分かったね、めっちゃ凝るよー。だって、こっちに来たら最新の文具がたくさんあるっちゃもん」=“So you noticed. I do get really absorbed in it. Afterall, there's all sorts of new types of stationary here, that I've never seen before.”
「あんまりこだわりはないかなぁ……使えればいいって感じやね」=“Not really... As long as it's usable, I don't care.”
「んーと……もし良かったら他の話せん？」=“Mmm... Can we talk about something else?”
「この間、すごい派手な自転車に追い抜かれて……」=“The other day, someone passed by me on this really gaudy cycle...”
「ええぇー、そげな自転車あるん！？　どこで会ったん？　見たい見たい！」=“Eeeeh~, cycles like that exist!? Where was it? I wanna see it!”
「憧れの結婚式とかある？」=“Is there a specific type of marriage ceremony you long for?”
「あるよ～、女の子の憧れやもん！　でも、ドレスも白無垢も素敵やけん決められないっちゃね」=“There is~, every girl has one! But, both a wedding dress and a white kimono sound great, I can't really decide between them.”
「特にないかなぁ……相手の人に任せるよ」=“Not really... I'd leave it up to my partner.”
「憧れのデートってある？」=“Do you have an ideal date in mind?”
「う、うん。好きな人と一日中一緒に過ごすこと。ありきたりって言うのは禁止やけんね？」=“Y-Yeah. Just spending the whole day with the person I love. So you know, you're forbidden from saying that it's too ordinary, okay?”
「うーん、自分がデートしてる姿自体、想像できんけん……ないかも」=“Well, I can't even imagine myself going out on a date so... probably not?”
「告白は男子からするべきだと思う？」=“Do you think guys should be the ones to confess?”
「出来ればそうして欲しいなぁって思っとるよ……って、えへへ、なんか恥ずいかも」=“Personally, it would take a load off my shoulders, so yes... ehehe, it's kinda embarrassing though.”
「我慢出来んくなったら女子からだってするよー。それだけ好きってことやもん」=“If I feel like I can't endure it anymore then I'd do it even if I'm a girl. That's the depth of my love.”
「付き合ったら毎日電話とかしたいと思う？」=“Do you think you'd want to call your boyfriend daily if you got one?”
「うん、したいー！　絶対声聞きたくなるもん！」=“Yeah, I would! I'd want to hear their voice!”
「どうやろ？　私はどっちでもいいよ。相手がしたいって言ったら全然ＯＫやけどね」=“Who knows? I'd be fine either way. If my boyfriend wanted to though, I'd be perfectly fine with it.”
「もー、こういう話、なんか照れるけん……今はやめとこ？」=“Jeez, this sort of thing, it's really embarrassing... can we talk about something else for now?”

「ないない。みんな普通やもん……って、そんなこと言ったら、そういう話してるってバレバレやん！」=“None at all. Everyone's normal... --no, saying that just makes it even more obvious!”
「エッチなことに興味がある方だと思う？」=“Are you the type to be interested in lewd stuff?”
「う、うん……まぁ、年齢的にもそういう頃合いやと思うけど……あぅぅ、もぅ恥ずいぃ……」=“Y-Yeah... Well, I think it's normal for people our age... auuu, so embarrassing...”

「屋外でのエッチってどう思う？」=“Opinion on doing lewd stuff outside?”
「あ……有り……なんやないかな？　開放的やと思うし……うん」=“Ah... it's fine... I guess? It's pretty liberating too... yeah.”

「そ、そげんハレンチなこと、言わんといてよ～……」=“D-Don't bring up such things in broad daylight~...”
「君って方言の人相手でも全然平気なんやね。気にせず会話してくれるやん？」=“You seem to get on perfectly fine even with someone who speaks in a dialect for a conversation partner. Do you not mind it when you're talking to me?”

「えへへ、君がいいって言うなら……それでいいかも。なーんて」=“Ehehe, if you think it's good... then maybe that's good enough for me. Don't mind that last one.”
「細い人がいいんやね？　それじゃあ体型維持できるように頑張らないといかんね！」=“Slim people look nice, don't they? Guess I gotta do my best to maintain this figure then!”
「ふーん、そうなんやね」=“Hmmmm, of course.”

「やっ……もー、そげん見たら赤くなるって！」=“Ya--... jeez, if you stare at me that much, I'll go beet red!”
「やぁん、もー、降参するけん終わりにして？　見られるの苦手になるやん！」=“Iyaan, jeez, I give in so please stop? I won't be able to handle being looked at anymore!”
「あー、今、胸見とったやろ？　男の子って無意識のうちに見るって聞いたけど……本当なん？」=“Ah, you just looked at my chest, didn't you? I've heard that boys do it without even thinking... is it actually true?”

「私がこんな気持ちになっとるのに……なんで君は平気なん？」=“Even though I'm feeling like this... Why are you so calm?”
「きゃっ……いきなりどうしたん？　手触るのって結構特別なことやと思うんやけど……」=“Kyah--... What's gotten into you? I don't think touching someone's hand is something to do so non-chalantly though...”
「こ、こらっ……特別なことって言ったやろ？　遊び半分で触っちゃいかんって」=“H-Hey--... I'm telling you, it's something special, okay? Don't touch it just as a joke.”
「もー、触りすぎやけん！　それとも……君、私のこと、特別だと思ってくれてるん？」=“Jeez, you're touching it way too much! Wait, by any chance... am I someone special to you?”
「ひあっ！　い、今っ……完全に胸触ったやろ！？　嘘やん！　誤魔化されんもん！」=“Hyah--! J-Just now--... You touched my chest, didn't you!? I don't believe you! You won't fool me!”

「禁止って言ったのにー！　男の子ってみんなそうなん！？　それとも君が野獣なん！？」=“Even though I said that you weren't allowed! Are all boys like this?! Or are you just a brute!?”
「ふぁ……いきなり……ふぇ……ほ、ほらぁ、変な声が出るやん……」=“Fuah... all of a sudden... fueh... c-come on, see, you're making me make weird noises...”
「ふぇぇ……恥ずかしいのに……気持ち良くなる……でも恥ずかしい……やけんもうダメ」=“Fueeh... it's so embarrassing but... it feels good... but it's embarrassing... so leave it at that.”
「ふやっ……ダメって言ったのにー！　君、私の反応見て楽しんどるだけやろ？」=“Fuyah--... I told you to stop! You're just enjoying my reactions, aren't you?”
「うにゅ、ん……ほっぺたぷにぷに、楽しいん？」=“Unyuu, nn... Is it fun to boop my cheeks?”

「水着、似合っとう？　あんまり自信ないけん……でも、君に褒めてもらえるときゅんってするよ」=“Does this swimsuit look nice? I don't have much confidence in it... But, being praised by you really makes my heart throb.”
「なんで他の女の子ばっかり見ようと？　そんなん……妬くに決まっとーやん」=“Why are you only looking at other girls? If you that... of course I'll get jealous.”
「えへへ、君も来てくれたん？　恋人同士で屋上とか……ばり青春やん！」=“Ehehe, you came too? Together as lovers on the rooftop... so romantic!”

「なにか変な癖とかある？」=“Do you have any weird habits of any sort?”
「う……あ、あるよ。気付いたらいつも自分でほっぺた触っとるっちゃん……や、柔らかくて……うぅ……」=“Uu... I-I do. Before I realize it, I'm always touching my own cheeks... T-They're just so soft... Uuu...”
「うーん、自分じゃ分からんねぇ。もし良かったら、ちょっと恥ずいけど、君に探して欲しいかも」=“Well, I can't really tell myself. If you don't mind, it's a bit embarrassing but, I'd like you to look for some in me.”
「んー、なんかいな、ちょっと違う話の方が楽しいかもしれんね」=“Nnn, how do I say this, a different topic might be more fun.”
「この間さ、洗濯物干した日に限って雨が降って……」=“Recently, I feel like it always starts raining the second I hang the laundry out to dry...”
「あぁ……悲しいね。それ、授業どころやないやつやん」=“Aah... that's sad. See, they don't really teach you how to deal with that in class.”
「どうでもいい話なんだけど、最近ちょっと気付いたことがあって……」=“This is like, entirely not worth talking about but, I realized something the other day...”
「わわ、その話、すごいって！　そげん細かいところよく気付いたね！」=“Wawah, that's amazing! How did you even think about such an obscure thing?!”
「俺と一緒にいて楽しい？」=“Is it fun to be with me?”
「もー、当たり前やんそんなん。誰とおる時より楽しいよ」=“Dummy, that's obvious, isn't it? It's more fun to be with you than anyone else.”
「うーん、どうやろ……って、冗談冗談！　そんなん聞かんでも分かっとーやろ！」=“Well, who knows...--wait, that was a joke, a joke! You already know the answer to that question, no!?”
「理想の恋愛とかある？」=“Do you have an ideal in terms of romance?”
「あるよ。えっとね……い、今がまさに……その理想なんよ」=“I do. Erhm... w-what we have now... is that very ideal.”
「そういうのは無いかも。相手が君やったら何でもいいんよ」=“I don't think I do. I'm good with anything as long as you're my partner.”
「恋人同士だったら長電話も平気？」=“Would you be fine with long phone calls, if they were from your boyfriend?”
「もちろん。長電話というか……ずーっとお話しときたいよ。君と」=“Of course. Forget phone calls... I want to chat with them the whole day. With you.”
「電話よりも直接会って話す方が好きなんよね……やけん、出来るだけ一緒におろ？」=“I like direct chats more than phone calls... So, stay by my side as much as you can, okay?”
「今の彼氏って理想通り？」=“Does your current boyfriend match your ideals?”
「も、もー、なんでそげん恥ずかしいこと聞けるとー？　理想通りじゃなかったら付き合っとらんもん」=“J-Jeez, why are you asking me something so embarrassing? If you weren't my ideal boyfriend I wouldn't go out with you.”
「んー、どうかいな。私、理想高いけん……って、嘘やけんね！　君のこと、好いとーよ」=“Hmm, I wonder. My standards are pretty high, you know... --so you know, I'm just joking, okay?! I love you.”
「な、なんか照れる……私、もしかしたらこういう話題は苦手かもしれん……はぅぅ……」=“I-I'm getting kinda shy... I might be bad, with this sort of topic... hauuu...”
「やっぱりさ、恋人同士なら携帯の待受とかは相手の写真にするのかな」=“I'm curious, are you the type to put your boyfriend's photo as your phone's wallpaper?”
「嘘……君してないと！？　私なんてとっくの昔に……はぅ、恥ずい〜！」=“No way... you're saying you're not!? I already set mine to a photo of you a while ago... hauu, so embarrassing~!”
「毎朝、[H名]の顔見る度に幸せな気分になるんだよね」=“Everytime I get to see your face in the morning, [H名], it always puts me in a great mood.”
「そ、そげん恥ずかしいことっ……もう、私だってそうよ。君とおるだけで幸せやもん」=“S-Saying something so embarrassing... jeez, I'm the same way. I'm happy just being with you.”
「気になる体位とかある？」=“Is there a position you're interested in?”
「な、ないといえば嘘になるんやけどっ……それを今言うのも何か違う気がするー！」=“I-It would be a lie to say that I don't but--... For some reason I feel like I really shouldn't tell you that right now!”
「そ、そういうのは基本男の子に任せると！　女子は受け身なんよ！」=“I-I think that sort of thing should be left to boys! Girls are more the receivers!”
「色んなエッチしてみたい派？」=“Are you the type to sexually experiment?”
「え、えっと……そ、そうやね。好きな人とやったら……色々してみたい……かも……」=“E-Erhm... Y-Yeah. If it's with my beloved... I might want to... try a few things...”
「色んなって……どんなん？　だって程度にもよるやん！」=“Just... what sort of experiments? I mean, there should be a limit you don't cross!”
「自分は感じやすい方だと思う？」=“Do you think you're physically sensitive?”
「どうやろ？　くすぐったいの苦手やし……結構敏感なんかな？」=“Who knows? I can't handle being tickled... I guess I'm pretty sensitive?”
「もぅー！　そんなん分からんってばー。だって人と比べる機会とかないやん！」=“Jeez! I don't know about that sort of stuff. It's not like I have anyone to compare myself to!”
「激しいエッチとか好き？」=“Do you like it rough?”
「うぅ……多分よ？　多分やけどっ！　優しいのも激しいのも……どっちも好き……なんやない？」=“Uuu... probably? It's a probably at best, okay--?! I'm pretty sure... I like it either way... both gentle and rough...”
「は、激しすぎるのってどうなんやろ……優しくしっとり……みたいなのがいいかなぁ。……って、この話、恥ずいって！」=“I-I don't know about too much roughness... Soft and gentle... is good I think. ...--wuh, this topic, it's really embarrassing!”
「男の子って本当にそういう話好きなんやね。でも今はダメ」=“Boys really do love talking about that sort of stuff, don't they? But we can't right now.”
「女の子ってさ、エッチすればするほど、開放的になっていくらしいよ」=“Seems like girls tend to get more sexually open, the more they have sex.”
「もー、そういう情報どこで仕入れるん？　本当にエッチなんやからー！」=“Jeez, just where did you hear that? You're such a pervert!”
「恋人同士って……やっぱりエッチしたい時のサインとか決めるのかな」=“Since we're a couple... maybe we should pick out a sign in advance, to flash when we want to have sex.”
「はぅっ……ず、ずいぶん大人な話題やね……君は……決めたいん？」=“Hauu--... t-that's quite the adult talk... do you... want to pick one?”
「恋人同士で一緒にお風呂とかってどう思う？　恥ずくない？」=“What do you think about getting in the bath together? Is it embarrassing?”
「や、やっぱりそうよね。私も恥ずかしいと思う。うぅ……い、一緒に入りたいって思った自分のことが……」=“Y-You think so too, huh? I think it's embarrassing too. Uuu... A-Am I the only one who wanted to get in together...”
「本当？　やったらそのっ……思い切ってっ……って、ごめんー！　なんでもない！」=“Really? In that case then--... I could be pretty bold and--...--wuh, sorry! I said nothing!”
「二人で一緒に寝たとしたら……君は先に起きたい方？」=“If we were to sleep together... Would you try to get up before me?”
「む、さては私の寝顔見るつもりなんやね。やったら私は……寝ないで徹夜するもん」=“Muh, and I take it you'll try to take a look at my sleeping face, huh? In that case I'll... stay up the whole darn night.”
「えへへ、やったね。それじゃ私がしっかり寝顔見てあげるけんね！」=“Ehehe, great. In that case, I'll watch over your quietly sleeping face for you!”
「もしもよ？　もしも結婚とかしたら……君は基本的にリードしたい方？」=“Hypothetically, only hypothetically, if we were to get married... Are you someone who wants to take the lead?”
「ふふっ、そう言ってくれると安心するよ。私も……君にリードしてもらいたいと」=“Fufu--, that gives me peace of mind. I want you to... take the lead too.”
「えー、私が引っ張るん？　ううん、別に構わんよ。そういう君も可愛いなって思うけん」=“Eh, you want me to do the pulling? No, I don't particularly mind. I think that side of you is cute too.”
「昨日パンケーキ焼いたら上手に出来て……自分でもびっくりするくらい美味しかったとって！」=“Yesterday, I was making pancakes, and they came out so well... They were so good, even I was surprised and I made the darn things!”
「そうなの？　俺も食べてみたいな」=“Really? I wanna try them too now.”
「うん、いいよ！　私も君に味見して欲しいもん」=“Yeah, alright! I want you to try them too.”
「うぅ、眠い……昨日の夜、あんまり寝付けんくて……」=“Uuu, so sleepy... I wasn't able to sleep much last night...”
「何かしてたの？」=“Something happened?”
「ううん、ネットでね、ちょっと怖い話読んだけん……それで……はぅ……」=“No, you see, I read this scary story on the web... and... hauu...”
「今日友達から聞いたっちゃけど……うちの学園ってエッチな噂がいっぱいあって……」=“I only heard this from my friends today but... seems like there's lots of perverted rumours floating around about our school...”
「うそ……マジでそんなことあるの？」=“No way... seriously?”
「うん、本当らしいよ。ま、まぁ、尾びれ背びれやとは思うけど……」=“Yeah, seems like it's true. W-Well, I think they're just exaggerations but...”
「ね、思い切って聞くけど……私のおっぱいって……好き？」=“Hey, I'll be upfront about this... Do you... like my boobs?”
「良かった……大きいのってね、実はちょっとコンプレックスやったりするんよ」=“I'm glad... I actually had a bit of a complex about my exaggerated bust size, you see.”
「ふふっ、君が好きって言ってくれるなら、このままのサイズを維持せないかんね」=“Fufu--, if you like them, then I'll have to do my best to maintain them as they are.”
「本当？　そう言ってもらえたらすっごく嬉しい。多分、もうサイズは変わらんと思うけん……あははっ」=“Really? Hearing that makes me really happy. Besides, I don't think my bust size is going to change anytime soon... Ahaha--”
「私の身長ってどう思う？　あ、君から見てって意味やけど……」=“What do you think of my height? Ah, I mean, from your own viewpoint...”
「そうなん？　はぁぁ、安心したぁ……背高いの嫌って男の子も結構おるっちゃろ？　やから心配やったん」=“Really? Haaa, I feel so relieved... Well, there's lots of boys out there that don't like tall girls, no? So I was worried.”
「このくらいの身長が好きなんやね。うん、君が好きって思ってくれることが大事なんよ」=“You like girls about this tall, huh? Yeah, what's important to me is that you like it.”
「えへへ、いつも上目遣いでごめんね。可愛い？　はぅ……そ、そういうこと言われると……お顔見れんくなるやん……」=“Ehehe, sorry for always looking at you like this. You think it's cute? Hauu... I-If you say that... I won't be able to look at your face...”
「ね、私って体型変やない？　君の好みに合っとう？」=“Hey, is my figure weird? Is it to your liking?”
「えへへ、君、ぽっちゃり好きなん？　本当？　嘘やない？　うぅ……私……嬉しすぎて甘えそう」=“Ehehe, you like plump girls? Really? You're not lying? Uuu... I feel so happy... I wanna fawn on you.”
「良かったー。個性がない体型やけん、ちょっと心配しとったと」=“I'm so glad. It's not really all that unique a figure, so I was a bit worried.”
「あんまり細いのもちょっと……って思っとったけど、君がいいって言ってくれるなら、このままでいいね！」=“Being too thin is bad too... I used to think that, anyway, but if you like it then I'm fine as is, aren't I!”
「そうなん……ま、まぁでも、全部が好み通りになれるわけないもんね！」=“I see... B-But well, I guess not every star will align everytime!”
「ねぇ……なんで私が聞きたい言葉言ってくれんと？　嫌いなん？」=“Hey... why won't you say the words I want to hear? Do you hate me?”
「えへへ……もうご機嫌。君の手に掛かったら、私なんてすぐに機嫌良くなるん」=“Ehehe... I'm already over it. Once I fall into your hands, I always cool down right away.”
「そのくらいじゃ許さんもん。本当に怒っとっちゃけんね！」=“I won't let you off with just that much. I'm really mad, you know!”
「見つめ合うん？　ふふっ、君、格好いいよ♪」=“We gonna look each other in the eyes? Fufu--, you're so cool♪”
「やだっ、ちょっとドキドキしてくる……」=“Gosh--, my heart's throbbing so much...”
「もう見たらいかんって。ばり恥ずかしいもん」=“Don't look at me anymore, it's really embarrassing.”
「ふふっ、そんなに私の胸が気になるん？　まぁ、男の子にはないものやもんね」=“Fufu--, are you that curious about my chest? Well, I guess that's to be expected, boys don't have any afterall.”
「ちょっと見過ぎやない？　あっ、ううん、別に嫌なわけじゃないとよ？」=“Aren't you staring too much? Ah--, no, not to say I hate it, okay?”
「君、もしかして私におっぱいって言わせたいだけやろ？　言っちゃーけん、これ以上見たらいかんよ？　はい、おっぱい♪　おっぱい♪」=“You just want me to say "Boobs", don't you? I'll say it, so don't look at them so much, okay? Here, Boobs♪ Boobs♪”
「もう……彼女が拗ねとるのくらい分かるやろ？」=“Jeez... you should be able to tell when your girlfriend is sulking, no?”
「あんっ……もー、急に握るけん、変な声出たやん」=“Ahn--... jeez, you grabbed at it so suddenly, you made me make such a weird sound.”
「にぎにぎされるの嫌いじゃないっちゃけど……実はめっちゃ緊張するんよ？」=“I don't hate it when you grab at me like this but... It's actually really nerveracking, you know?”
「うぅぅ、握るのここまでにして？　これ以上はドキドキが止まらんくなるけん……」=“Uuuu, please just leave it at that? Any more and I won't be able to calm down...”
「えぇっ、不意打ちでそんなとこ触るん？　さすがにびっくりなんやけど」=“Eee--, you're going to grab me there without even a word? That really caught me by surprise.”
「こ、こらぁ、冗談でもいかんよ？　はい、もうないない♪」=“H-Hey, come on, even as a joke, that's no good you know? Come on, stop it there♪”
「ひゃぁんっ、またおっぱいー！　私の彼氏って……もしかして変な人なんかいな」=“Hyan--, my boobs again! Is my boyfriend... actually a pervert?”
「あっ、ふぁっ……ひゃぅっ……え、えへへ、ナデナデされるとやっぱり変な声が出るん」=“Ah--, fuah--... hyaau--... e-ehehe, when you pat me, I really can't help but make weird sounds.”
「ふわわっ、はわっ、も、もうっ、気持ちいいけど恥ずかしいけんおしまい」=“Fuwawah--, hawah--, j-jeez--, it feels great but it's embarrassing so no more.”
「やんっ！　あっ、あぁんっ！　き、君、絶対楽しんどるやろ？　もー、バカー！」=“Yahn--! Ah--, Aahn--! Y-You're enjoying this, aren't you? Jeez, you dummy!”
「ひゃ……ぅ……ふふっ、どうしたん？　急に触りたくなったと？」=“Hyah... uu... fufu--, what's up? Just felt like touching me?”
「にゃんっ、んんっ、私のほっぺ、そげん柔らかいん？」=“Nyahn--, nn--, are my cheeks that soft?”
「はぅっ、うぅぅ、こ、ここまでにしよ？　なんか……大きい声じゃ言えんような気持ちになるけん……あははっ」=“Hauu--, uuu, l-let's leave it at that, okay? I feel like... I can't bring myself to say it all that strongly... ahaha--”
「むぅぅ、今の私は不機嫌だからダーメ。まずは仲直りから……やろ？」=“Muuu, I'm in a bad mood right now so don't do that. Let's first make up... okay?”
「君と話しとったら、私あっと言う間にハッピーになるっちゃん♪」=“When I chat with you, I always start feeling happy in no time♪”
「なんやろ……君のこと見とったら、ドキドキして……身体熱くなるんよ……」=“I wonder what it is... when I look at you, my heart starts racing... I feel hot and bothered...”
「いっぱいお話しよ？　君とやったらどんなこと話しても楽しいんよ」=“Let's talk lots? With you, everything we chat about is fun.”
「えへへ、私の彼氏は何考えとるんかな♪」=“Ehehe, what's my boyfriend thinking?♪”
「もう話すのも嫌になったん？　やったら別に……無理せんでもいいとよ？」=“Have you gotten fed up of talking to me? In that case, you don't really have to... force yourself, you know?”
「ごめん、ちょっとこれ以上話したくないけん、またね」=“Sorry, I don't really want to talk any more, so maybe next time.”
「君、全然私のこと分かってくれんっちゃね。ううん、よく分かったけん、いい。じゃ、またね」=“You really don't understand a single thing about me, do you? No, I get it, so it's fine. Well then, bye.”
「あ、もう時間ないーっ！　もっともっとお話したいんやけどなぁ……離れたくないんやけどなぁ……ううぅ……」=“Ah, I don't have any more time--! I wanted to talk for much, much longer too... I don't really want to part here either... Uuuu...”
「あ、あのね……今は時間ないけど……今度は二人きりで、その……色々して欲しいん」=“H-Hey... I don't have time right now but... next time, let's, uhm... do lots more stuff together.”
「あ、そろそろ行かな。ごめんね、じゃ、また！」=“Ah, I gotta go. Sorry, bye, till next time!”
「次もたくさんお話しようね。私、まだまだ話し足りんっちゃん」=“Let's talk lots next time too. I still haven't talked enough with you~”
「はーい、またね」=“Yes, bye~”
「うん……分かった……ううん、私がこんなんやけん、無理なんやろ？　大丈夫、分かっとーつもりやけん……」=“Yeah... got it... no, I'm like this after all, so it's impossible, no? It's alright, I understand...”
「あのね、色々考えたっちゃけど……私たち、別れた方がいいっちゃないかな。多分、もう無理やけん……」=“Hey, I thought about it a bunch and... wouldn't it be better if we broke up? I don't think it's possible, between us anymore...”
「もー、君って本当にはっきり言うんやね。でも……うん、いいよ。本当はね……私もしたいっちゃん」=“Jeez, you really don't do the whole "subtlety" thing, do you? But... yeah, alright. The truth is... I want to do it too.”

「さすがにここじゃ有り得んって。無理。絶対無理。絶望的に無理やけん！」=“We really can't do it here. Nope. Definitely nope. It's definitely hopeless so just give up, okay?!”
「ひ、人が来るかもしれんよ？　あ……ふふっ、うん、分かっとーよ。そのドキドキがいいっちゃもんね。うん、しよ♪」=“P-People might walk in on us, you know? Ah... fufu--, yeah, I understand. That's what's good about it, isn't it? Yeah, let's do it♪”

「うんっ、誘ってくれるの待っとったとよ！　君から元気補充せんと、午後乗り切れんっちゃん」=“Yeah--, I was waiting for you to ask me! If I can't recharge my affection bar, I can't get through the day.”
「ね、もし先約がなかったらお昼一緒に食べん？」=“Hey, if you don't already have plans, wanna get lunch together?”
「やった！　カップルでお昼ご飯とかめっちゃ青春って感じやんね」=“Yay! Grabbing lunch together as a couple, it really feels like we're living the springtime of our lives, doesn't it?”
「うそー、先約あると？　うーん、やったら仕方ないね。また別の日に誘うけん」=“No way, you have plans already? No, it can't be helped then. I'll ask you out on another day.”

「運動？　うん、いいよー！　体育の時間だけじゃ全然足りんもんね！」=“Exercise? Sure, I'm up for some! Doing it only during PE classes is not enough at all, after all!”
「時間あったら、ちょっと身体動かさん？　あっ、変な意味じゃないけんね！　普通にスポーツとかっ！」=“If you have time, wanna move bodies together? Ah--, I don't mean it like that, so you know! Let's do some sports or something--!”
「やってくれるん？　良かったー！　しっかり身体動かした方が、ぐっすり眠れるっちゃん」=“You will? Great~! It's much easier to sleep at night, when you get some proper exercise in the day.”
