# KoikatsuTranslation

This is an English-language translation of the Illusion eroge [Koikatsu.](http://illusion.jp/preview/koikatu/) By making use of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and specific [BepisPlugins for Koikatsu](https://github.com/bbepis/BepisPlugins), we are able to provide a translation for the game. Please note that translation won't be instant - our team is small, and there is a lot of dialogue to translate in the game.

Note that in addition to Master, there are other branches for various team members. It's possible that these may be more up-to-date than Master, but they are often using Bleeding Edge versions of [BepinEx](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepinex_be) or [BepisPlugins.](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepis_plugins) While they *should* work with your game or version of BepInEx, they are often also testing new features or additions to the codebase, so they may not without updating to a Bleeding Edge build (which could have bugs), so if you would rather play it safe, stick to Master and the "official" releases. For Bleeding Edge BepInEx, Koikatsu only ever needs the x64 build - x32 is for other Unity games that BepInEx supports that have a 32-bit build.

### Helping Out
If you're interested in helping out to speed up this translation, ***have knowledge of Japanese,*** and have decent English conversational skills, you can reach out on Discord (**Dark Pulse#7622**). The more people we have, the faster a translation could be produced, so if you've got the skills, we'd like to hear from you! (Also possibly the faster an English version is produced, the faster other languages could be produced as well by other teams.)
